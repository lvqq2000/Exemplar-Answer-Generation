It is named after a substance in a  Dr Seuss  book called  Bartholomew and the Oobleck .&nbsp;    This liquid is a runny goo until you apply force to it, and then it acts like a solid. If you hit it with a hammer, the particles lock together and it becomes hard.    You can roll it into a solid ball in your hand.

        "examplar_answer":"Blood being a stir-thinning non-Newtonian fluid is essential for its function in the body. When the heart pumps blood, it applies force, which causes the blood to become thinner. This characteristic is beneficial as it helps blood flow more easily through the veins and arteries. If blood remained thick, it could create resistance, making it harder for the heart to pump effectively and potentially leading to health issues such as high blood pressure or clotting.\n\nAdditionally, the ability of blood to become thinner under pressure allows it to adapt to varying conditions. For example, during physical activity, the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients requires blood to flow more rapidly. The stir-thinning property ensures efficient circulation, helping deliver these vital substances throughout the body without excessive strain on the heart.\n\nIn summary, blood's behavior as a stir-thinning non-Newtonian fluid allows for easier and more efficient circulation, which is critical for maintaining healthy bodily functions."

All of the eight planets in our solar system revolve or orbit around the Sun. These revolutions or orbits vary greatly and can affect the seasons and general weather conditions found on each planet.    Orbits come in different shapes. All orbits are  elliptical , which means they are an ellipse, similar to an oval.&nbsp;      The Earth's orbit     Our Earth revolves or orbits around the Sun every 365 and \u00bc days. This extra \u00bc of a day adds up to a full day every 4 years (\u00bc + \u00bc+ \u00bc + \u00bc = 1) and is why we have a  leap year  with an extra day every 4 years.

        "examplar_answer":"The Earth's orbit around the Sun is an elliptical shape, which means it is slightly elongated and not a perfect circle. This means that there are points in the orbit where Earth is closer to the Sun, called perihelion, and points where it is farther away, known as aphelion. The average distance from the Earth to the Sun is about 93 million miles, which is referred to as an astronomical unit (AU). \n\nThe elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit is a key characteristic of how planets move within our solar system. As part of a system of planets, Earth travels around the Sun due to the gravitational pull of the Sun's mass, and this gravitational interaction keeps the Earth and other planets in their specific orbits. Understanding the shape of the orbit helps explain various phenomena such as the changing seasons and variations in sunlight throughout the year. Thus, the Earth, along with other planets, orbits the Sun while following the natural laws of physics that govern celestial bodies."

        "task_content":"How do enzymes help digestion?    Digestive enzymes    An  enzyme  is a type of  catalyst.  A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a specific chemical reaction. In digestion, most enzymes are used to chemically breakdown a specific large substance into its smaller chemical \u2018building block\u2019 components.  All digestive enzymes are  hydrolases , which means they use water to break chemical bonds joining larger molecules together. When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall.      Digestive Enzymes      Each digestive enzyme is specialised to produce one type of chemical reaction which breaks down one specific substance. So our digestive system has many different types of enzymes. Some of the main ones are below.

        "examplar_answer":"In the trypsin experiment, the results demonstrated that trypsin effectively breaks down proteins into smaller molecules, specifically peptides. Our experimental design included the use of a protein substrate, which was exposed to the enzyme trypsin under controlled conditions. We observed the reaction over time and measured the rate at which the protein was degraded.\n\nQuantitative data collected indicated a significant decrease in the concentration of the intact protein as the reaction progressed. This is evidence suggesting that trypsin was actively hydrolyzing the peptide bonds within the protein structure. The production of smaller peptide fragments can be inferred from the use of specific assays that detect these molecules, such as the Biuret test or chromatographic methods.\n\nAdditionally, we compared the initial and final states of the substrate using electrophoresis, which showed distinct bands corresponding to the original protein and the generated peptides. The disappearance of the original protein band, paired with the appearance of new bands in the region where peptides would migrate, strongly supports the conclusion that trypsin cleaves the protein into smaller peptide units.\n\nFurthermore, our observations align with established scientific concepts regarding the function of digestive enzymes like trypsin. Trypsin is a serine protease that specifically targets peptide bonds, particularly those adjacent to certain amino acids. The experimental evidence collected corresponds with these known mechanisms, confirming that the enzymatic activity of trypsin is responsible for the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides.\n\nIn conclusion, the cumulative evidence from our experiment clearly indicates that trypsin breaks down proteins into smaller peptides, as demonstrated by the quantitative reduction of intact protein, the formation of new peptide bands in electrophoresis, and the alignment of our findings with established enzymatic mechanisms."

        "task_content":"Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm . Measure its&nbsp;height with a ruler  Measure the mass of the toy car (in kilograms) and record it  Place the toy car at the top of the incline and release it. Measure the time it takes the car to reach the bottom of the incline. Attempt two time measurements at each height for reliability of the results.

Repeat Step 7       How might your findings affect the design of a slide in a playground?   The energy of an object changes from potential to kinetic energy when sliding down an incline. The speed of the object depends on the height it is released from.

        "examplar_answer":"The toy car is traveling the fastest at the height of 30 cm. This is indicated by the time values recorded during the experiment. As the height of the incline increases, the potential energy of the car also increases, which translates into greater kinetic energy as it descends the ramp. The results show that the time taken for the car to travel down the incline decreased as the height was raised; specifically, the toy car took the least amount of time to reach the bottom from the 30 cm incline when compared to the 20 cm and 10 cm heights. This supports the conclusion that the greater the height from which the car is released, the greater its speed will be as it converts potential energy into kinetic energy while moving down the incline."

It is made up of a rainbow of different colours and will be  absorbed ,  reflected ,  refracted , or  transmitted  if it hits another object.&nbsp;    When white visible light, such as sunlight or light from a torch, travels from air through water then back into air again, it is  refracted . This means that the light bends as it passes at an angle from one transparent thing (air, glass or water) into another. When this happens, our view of an object is distorted.&nbsp;     Visible light and rainbows     How much a light is refracted depends on the wavelength of the light. The shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. Lights of different colours have different wavelengths, so each colour is refracted by different amounts. Therefore, white visible light is split up after passing from air to water and the individual colours become visible.&nbsp;    This scattering of light allows us to see the spectrum of colours that form a rainbow.

Start with red at the top left, followed by orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and finish with violet at the top right. \n\nIn terms of the science behind rainbows, they form when light from the sun refracts, or bends, as it enters water droplets in the atmosphere. This bending of light causes it to separate into different colours, forming a spectrum. Shadows are created when an object blocks the path of light, preventing it from reaching the surface behind the object. \n\nBy understanding the properties of light, such as its ability to travel in straight lines and to be reflected or refracted, we can appreciate the beauty of a rainbow."

They are made up of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. These mixtures are examples of  reversible  changes in that they can be separated back into their original substances.&nbsp;  For example, if we mix salt into water, we will make a mixture. However, this mixture can be separated back into salt and water. This can be done by evaporating the water, which leaves behind the salt.&nbsp;   Mixtures &amp; solubility   If a substance can dissolve in water, we can say it is  soluble . If a substance cannot dissolve in water, it is  insoluble .&nbsp;  Some insoluble substances will sink to the bottom and some will float to the top. Some will do both while others are suspended in the water.&nbsp;  For example, when you swim in the ocean you can't see chunks of salt in the water, even though you know that the sea is salty. This is because the salt has dissolved in the water - it is soluble. But if you were eating some corn and some corn kernels fell into the water, they wouldn't be dissolved.

I know this because when I added these substances to water, they did not dissolve or mix with the water. Instead, the sand settled at the bottom of the container, and the oil formed a layer on top of the water. This indicates that they do not undergo a reversible change like dissolving, as they do not form a solution with water. In contrast, soluble substances like salt and sugar dissolved completely in the water, showing that they can change states but still remain the same substance. This comparison illustrates the difference between reversible changes, such as dissolving, and the behavior of insoluble substances."

        "task_content":"Which sites do we preserve?  We can't preserve every single ancient site across the world - there are simply too many. So, how do we decide where to direct time, money, and effort when choosing which sites to protect?  &nbsp;    UNESCO world heritage sites    One of the duties of  UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization)  is to identify and protect ancient sites. These are designated as  World Heritage sites . World Heritage sites are places that have outstanding universal value to humanity and, therefore, need to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.      What are UNESCO World Heritage Sites     ?     Check out the interactive map below that shows all the World Heritage sites. How many have you been to?      Map of World Heritage Sites       What makes a world heritage site?   UNESCO uses 10 different criteria to identify which sites are deserving of protection as World Heritage sites. They are summarised in the image below, but the full explanation of each criteria can be found at the link below.      World Heritage Sites - Selection Criteria          The first six criteria usually apply to historical sites (like the Acropolis in Athens), and the last four criteria usually apply to natural sites (like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia).  Of course, an ancient site doesn't need to be recognised as a World Heritage site to be worthy of protection. There are many ancient sites across the world that haven't been designated a World Heritage site but which are still carefully preserved. But the criteria used for awarding World Heritage status is still a useful guide for us when we decide whether an ancient or historical site should be protected.   How do you think the heritage site fits your criteria?   Do you think your chosen criteria point is the most important? Why or why not?   Does your chosen criteria connect to the reasons to preserve ancient sites that you have explored previously? Why or why not? ",
        "examplar_answer":"I believe that the significance and importance of conserving the remains and heritage of the past is indeed one of the most crucial criteria to consider when evaluating focus selection. This criterion holds paramount importance because our cultural heritage is fundamental to our identity and our understanding of human history. By preserving our past, we can learn from it, ensuring that valuable lessons and experiences are not lost to time. \n\nConserving heritage allows future generations to connect with their ancestry and provides a tangible link to cultural narratives, traditions, and events that have shaped societies. It fosters a sense of belonging and community, enhancing the appreciation of diverse histories. Moreover, understanding historical remnants can inform present-day decisions and inspire innovative approaches to contemporary challenges rooted in past experiences.\n\nWhile other criteria may focus on aspects such as technological innovation or economic development, they often risk overshadowing the foundational importance of our collective memory and the lessons embedded in our history. Without a well-preserved heritage, we lose not only physical structures and artifacts but also the cultural significance and knowledge they provide.\n\nIn conclusion, while each selection criterion has its own merits, the preservation of heritage stands out because it serves as a vital reservoir of knowledge, identity, and continuity, making it an essential focus in our efforts to sustain and celebrate our shared human experience."

        "examplar_answer":"A centrifuge is a device that uses rapid spinning to separate substances of different densities within a mixture. The basic principle behind centrifugation is that when a mixture is spun at high speeds, the denser particles are forced outward to the bottom or the sides of the container, while the lighter substances remain closer to the center. This separation occurs due to the centrifugal force generated by the spinning motion.\n\nIn the context of stormwater treatment, a centrifuge can significantly help clean our stormwater by removing suspended solids, pollutants, and other contaminants. Stormwater often contains a mixture of various particles such as dirt, oil, heavy metals, and organic matter. By applying the principles of centrifugation, these mixtures can be separated effectively.\n\nWhen stormwater is treated using a centrifuge, the heavier contaminants and particles settle out quickly under the influence of the centrifugal force. This process aligns with the particle model of matter, which states that substances can be classified as pure substances or mixtures based on their particle composition. Pure substances have uniform properties and structure, while mixtures consist of two or more different substances that retain their individual properties. In stormwater, the contaminants and sediments represent a mixture, which can be separated through centrifugation.\n\nAs the centrifuge spins, denser materials such as sand, silt, and certain pollutants are separated from the cleaner water. This cleaner water can then be discharged or further treated, effectively reducing the pollution load entering our water bodies. By understanding the properties of these substances and how they interact in a mixture, centrifugation presents a valuable method for improving overall stormwater quality, making it a crucial technique in environmental management and water treatment systems."

If bee populations fall, we would have less resources and we might face more severe famines\"",
        "task_title":"What's happening to bees?",
        "task_content":"What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? ",
        "examplar_answer":"The decline in bee populations is a significant concern for humans and our society due to the critical role these pollinators play in the reproduction of flowering plants, known as angiosperms. Bees are responsible for pollinating approximately one-third of the food crops we rely on, including fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Without these pollinators, many of these plants would fail to reproduce, leading to a decrease in crop yields and ultimately threatening food security.\n\nFurthermore, the decline of bee populations can disrupt entire ecosystems. Angiosperms are not only vital for human food supply but also provide habitats and food sources for countless other species. A loss of plant diversity can lead to a cascading effect on these ecosystems, impacting animal species and biodiversity.\n\nAdditionally, the economic implications of declining bee populations cannot be overlooked. The agricultural sector relies heavily on bees for crop production. Reduced yields can lead to higher food prices and economic instability for farmers and communities that depend on agriculture. \n\nIn summary, the decline in bee populations poses a multifaceted threat to human life, affecting food production, ecosystems, and economic stability. It highlights the importance of conservation efforts to protect these essential pollinators."

        "task_content":"Why do we recycle paper?    What is recycling?    The word recycle has two meanings - to convert waste into reusable materials, or to use something again.&nbsp;  Recycling when converting waste is a  reversible change . This means that some materials which are used to create different objects can be transformed back into the original material. For example, glass which is used to make a glass bottle can then be changed back into a sheet of glass, that can be recycled to make a glass tabletop.&nbsp;      Introduction to Recycling      Recycling is important because:    It allows us to reuse resources, some of which are limited or finite    It reduces landfill so that we have less rubbish in the world    It saves energy as making new products uses more energy than recycling old ones    By saving energy, we are also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. This helps to reduce global warming which is causing climate change     Does it use more or less energy to recycle paper than it does to create new paper?   Why is it important that we recycle paper? Give and explain three reasons ",
        "examplar_answer":"Recycling paper is important for several reasons, each contributing to environmental conservation and sustainability.\n\nFirstly, recycling paper helps to conserve natural resources. The production of paper typically requires significant amounts of trees, water, and energy. When we recycle paper, we reduce the need to cut down more trees, which helps preserve forests and the biodiversity they support. By reusing existing materials, we lessen the demand for virgin resources, allowing us to maintain a healthier ecosystem.\n\nSecondly, recycling paper reduces waste and lowers the amount of material sent to landfills. Landfills can produce harmful gases, such as methane, as organic materials decompose. By recycling paper, we divert it from landfills and reduce overall waste. This action minimizes pollution and the environmental impacts associated with waste management. Additionally, it promotes a more circular economy, where materials are reused and recycled rather than disposed of.\n\nThirdly, recycling paper contributes to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The paper recycling process generally emits fewer greenhouse gases compared to making paper from raw materials. For example, recycling paper requires less energy, which often comes from fossil fuels. By reducing energy consumption, we can mitigate climate change and work towards a more sustainable future. Thus, every sheet of paper we recycle plays a role in reducing our carbon footprint.\n\nIn summary, recycling paper is vital because it conserves natural resources, reduces waste, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. Through these actions, individuals and communities can collectively address environmental challenges and make informed decisions that positively impact our planet."

        "task_content":"Separating oil and water    Reversible changes    When two or more substances are mixed together, they can sometimes be separated again into two different substances. This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible.

We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea.&nbsp;  This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water.

        "examplar_answer":"In a filtration process, the materials left behind on the filter paper typically include solid particles that do not pass through the filter. This can include undissolved substances or larger particles that are unable to fit through the tiny pores of the filter paper. For example, if we were filtering a mixture of sand and salt dissolved in water, the sand would remain on the filter paper while the salt solution would pass through.\n\nThe reason these solid particles are left behind is that filtration works on the principle of separating mixtures based on particle size. The solid particles are considered irreversible changes because they form distinct substances that do not revert to their original state once filtered. Unlike the dissolved salt, which is in a reversible change\u2014meaning it can be recovered by evaporating the water\u2014the sand remains physically unchanged but separated from the liquid. This process illustrates the difference between reversible changes, like dissolving, and irreversible changes, such as filtering out insoluble substances."

For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely.

When we cool water below its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius), the water molecules lose energy and move slower. As a result, they come closer together and arrange themselves into a solid structure, forming ice. This change from a liquid state to a solid state highlights how different forms of matter (solids, liquids, and gases) have distinct observable properties and behaviors. For instance, while water is a liquid that flows and takes the shape of its container, ice is a solid that holds its shape and does not flow.

An effective  nose cone  and  fins  will help to stabilise your rocket.&nbsp;    So, to create a rocket that can be launched into space, you must design:     A rocket body    Fins &amp; a nose cone    A final rocket design with all elements     In your teams, you must:     Design your nose cones and fins\/tail. Think about which materials to use and how to attach them before constructing their designs    Two team members could construct the nose cone and the other two could construct the fins\/tail design. Your team needs to ensure that the canister lid is kept clear so that it can still come away from the canister during the launch    You will need to do two trials of each (or more if there are launching issues). You should note whether the rocket launched straight up and if their rocket was rolling or was stable.

        "examplar_answer":"In this experiment, we tested different fin designs to determine which one was most effective for stability and maneuverability. The fin designs we examined included a straight fin, a curved fin, and a multi-layer fin. After conducting trials with each design, we measured their performance based on how well they kept the craft straight on a course and how easily they changed direction.\n\nThe fin design that worked best was the curved fin. This design allowed the craft to maintain a straight trajectory while also providing the responsiveness needed for quick turns. We measured this performance by timing how long it took for the craft to travel a set distance and by observing how sharply it could navigate turns. We kept certain variables constant, such as the size and weight of the craft, and the water conditions during the testing.\n\nIn our observations, the curved fin consistently resulted in faster times on straight runs and smoother, quicker turns compared to the other designs. This suggests that the aerodynamics of the curved fin reduced drag while enhancing maneuverability, allowing the craft to perform better overall.\n\nIn conclusion, the curved fin was the most effective design because it balanced stability and maneuverability, leading to superior performance during the tests we conducted. I controlled the factors during the experiment and recorded detailed data on each fin's performance, which supported our findings."

",
        "examplar_answer":"If I wanted to make a bathroom window that allows light in while also providing some privacy, I would choose frosted glass as the material. Frosted glass is created by sandblasting or acid etching clear glass, which gives it a translucent appearance. This means that while light can still pass through the glass, any shapes or figures on the other side are diffused and appear blurry. \n\nUsing frosted glass in a bathroom setting is scientifically beneficial because it addresses two common needs: adequate natural light and privacy. In many homes, bathrooms often lack windows or have small openings, which can make them feel closed off or claustrophobic. By installing frosted glass windows, homeowners can enhance the space with natural light without sacrificing their privacy. \n\nMoreover, scientific principles related to optics and light behavior support this choice. The way light interacts with frosted surfaces demonstrates how material properties can be used to solve everyday problems. Hence, frosted glass not only fulfills practical needs but also reflects an understanding of scientific principles in design choices."

        "examplar_answer":"The findings from my research can significantly influence the design of a swing in a playground in two main ways. \n\nFirst, one crucial aspect is safety. If studies indicate that swings with a certain height or distance from the ground reduce the risk of injuries, this information should inform the design specifications. Incorporating these findings ensures swings are not only fun but also minimize the risk of falls or collisions, particularly for younger children who may not have the same level of coordination. Thus, the design could include lower seat heights or padded materials around the swing area, based on scientific evidence regarding injury prevention.\n\nSecond, my findings regarding the importance of physical activity for children's health could also impact swing design. If research shows that swings can stimulate more active play\u2014perhaps through designs that encourage movement or multiple users\u2014then new designs could be developed to enhance engagement. For instance, incorporating features like adjustable swing heights or tandem swings could promote physical activity among children, supporting community health initiatives and encouraging more children to play actively.\n\nOverall, effective science communication plays a critical role in translating these findings into practical applications, ensuring that community policies prioritize safety and health in playground design. Being informed by scientific evidence allows playground designers and local policymakers to create spaces that not only entertain but also promote well-being among children."

There are many different tectonic plates and each of them are a different size. Look at the image below - it shows you a picture with all the different tectonic plates and where they are located. Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth\u2019s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of  magma  (molten rock) push the plates in different directions.  This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called  continental drift .  We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant  supercontinent  called  Pangaea .

This is called  rust .&nbsp;    R\u00adust is the common name for a very common compound,  iron oxide.  Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker.    Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.

        "examplar_answer":"We left the lid off Jar 1 to allow the water to evaporate. In this case, the change is reversible because when water evaporates, it turns into water vapor, but if we were to add water back in, it would return to its liquid state. This is different from irreversible changes, like cooking or rusting, which create new substances that cannot go back to their original forms. \n\nBy removing the lid, we could observe the process of evaporation more effectively. In contrast, when ingredients in cooking are combined and heated, they undergo irreversible changes that result in new substances like baked bread or caramelized sugar, which cannot simply revert back to their original components. Thus, the decision to leave the lid off Jar 1 was intentional to demonstrate a reversible change, highlighting how some processes, like dissolving and changes of state, are temporary and can be reversed, while others lead to permanent transformations."

This reinforces the idea that light can pass through transparent materials while being blocked by others. \n\nFurthermore, the ability of these transparent materials to bend light (refraction) adds to the evidence that they are indeed transparent; for example, when looking through a glass of water, the straw appeared bent at the surface, demonstrating how light changes direction as it travels through different mediums. Overall, my explanations are based on direct observations and principles of light behavior."

        "answer":"\"Reconstruction can allow people to see exactly what the site might have looked like. It can make the site more stable and secure, and less likely to decay. However, there is a risk that you change the site too much so it no longer resembles what it used to look like. This would diminish its historical significance.However, on balance I think reconstruction is an effective way to preserve ancient sites. It is better to have a reconstructed site which allows people to immerse themselves in history than not to have a site at all!\"",
        "task_title":"How do we preserve ancient sites?",
        "task_content":"How do we preserve ancient sites?  All ancient sites deteriorate over time. The most we can do is slow time's impact through preventive measures and restoration. But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.   If you could make one change to the site to restore or reconstruct it, what would you do? Why?   Of the digital preservation methods you explored, which one do you think best preserves ancient sites? Is digital preservation a good strategy for preserving ancient sites?   How can we mitigate risks to ancient sites from extreme weather events?&nbsp; &nbsp;   What are the benefits and potential risks of reconstruction? In your opinion, is this an effective way to protect or preserve an ancient site?   How could you make this site more accessible for tourists, without damaging the integrity of the site?   Describe two ways that education can help protect ancient sites   Use the World Heritage site from ancient Greece you looked at in the previous task (when looking at the selection criteria). Search for it on    Google Earth     .   Use the street view function to look around the ancient site.  What threats do you think it faces now or might have faced in the past? Why do you think this is the case? ",
        "examplar_answer":"Reconstruction of ancient sites can offer several significant benefits as well as potential risks that must be considered. One of the primary benefits of reconstruction is the preservation of cultural heritage, allowing future generations to connect with their history. Reconstructed sites can serve as educational resources, providing insights into past civilizations and their architectural practices. They can also contribute to local economies through tourism, attracting visitors who wish to experience and learn about ancient cultures firsthand.\n\nAdditionally, reconstruction can help prevent the complete loss of sites that are deteriorating due to natural processes or human activities. By recreating structures and spaces, we can maintain the historical narrative and foster a sense of identity within communities, as these sites often serve as symbols of pride and continuity.\n\nHowever, there are potential risks associated with reconstruction that can undermine its benefits. One of the main concerns is the authenticity of the reconstructed site. A reconstruction may not accurately reflect the original structure, leading to questions about the site\u2019s historical integrity and value. The aesthetic and cultural significance of the original may be lost, making it difficult for visitors to fully appreciate the genuine artifact of the past.\n\nMoreover, reconstruction can sometimes lead to the commercialization of heritage, prioritizing tourism and profit over genuine preservation efforts. This commodification can alter the site\u2019s significance and diminish its authenticity in the eyes of scholars and cultural purists. Furthermore, there is the potential of damaging remaining original structures during the reconstruction process, as well as the risk of neglecting sites that are left unrestored, leading to further degradation.\n\nIn my opinion, while reconstruction can be an effective way to protect or preserve ancient sites, it must be approached with caution and a strong emphasis on historical accuracy. The primary focus should be on conservation and maintenance of what remains of the original site. When reconstruction is deemed necessary, it should be done transparently and with input from historians, archaeologists, and relevant stakeholders to ensure that it honors the essence of the original heritage. Balancing the benefits of reconstruction with its potential risks is crucial in safeguarding the significance and importance of conserving the remains and heritage of the past."
