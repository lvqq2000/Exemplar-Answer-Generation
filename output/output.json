        "task_content":"Making Oobleck    What is Oobleck?      Oobleck  is a mixture of corn flour and water. It is named after a substance in a  Dr Seuss  book called  Bartholomew and the Oobleck .&nbsp;    This liquid is a runny goo until you apply force to it, and then it acts like a solid. If you hit it with a hammer, the particles lock together and it becomes hard.    You can roll it into a solid ball in your hand. But when you stop moving it, it reverts to liquid and oozes out through your fingers. In this case, the oobleck\u2019s viscosity or flow increases with applied force.   &nbsp;    Experiment - making Oobleck     Oobleck sounds like a magical liquid, right? But it's actually a real-life example of a non-Newtonian fluid. And it's really easy to make!       What is Oobleck?

Blood becomes thinner when force is applied to it - like when it is pumped by our heart. Explain why this is a good characteristic for blood to have   Non-Newtonian fluids are found in many places. Explain why cream is an example of a stir-thickening non-Newtonian fluid   You are walking through a jungle and come across a pit of quicksand. Quicksand acts like oobleck as it is a stir-thickening liquid. There is no way around the pit so you have to go through the quicksand. Using your knowledge of how oobleck worked, how would you attempt to get over the quicksand? Explain why you would do this   What happened when you hit your oobleck with your hand? What about when you grabbed some oobleck in your hand and made a ball?&nbsp;  Explain your answers ",
        "exemplar_answer":"Blood being a stir-thinning non-Newtonian fluid is advantageous because it allows for efficient circulation throughout the body. When the heart pumps, it generates pressure that causes the blood to become thinner. This decrease in viscosity enables the blood to flow more easily through the arteries and veins, ensuring that oxygen and nutrients are delivered effectively to tissues and organs. When the force is reduced, such as when the heart relaxes between beats, blood thickens slightly, which helps maintain pressure and flow. This characteristic is crucial for the dynamic nature of blood circulation, allowing it to adapt to the varying demands of the body during physical activity or rest."

All of the eight planets in our solar system revolve or orbit around the Sun. These revolutions or orbits vary greatly and can affect the seasons and general weather conditions found on each planet.    Orbits come in different shapes. All orbits are  elliptical , which means they are an ellipse, similar to an oval.&nbsp;      The Earth's orbit     Our Earth revolves or orbits around the Sun every 365 and \u00bc days. This extra \u00bc of a day adds up to a full day every 4 years (\u00bc + \u00bc+ \u00bc + \u00bc = 1) and is why we have a  leap year  with an extra day every 4 years.

        "exemplar_answer":"The Earth's orbit around the Sun is elliptical, meaning it is shaped like an elongated circle. This elliptical shape causes the distance between the Earth and the Sun to vary throughout the year.

This movement is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of our solar system, where all planets maintain their orbits in a balanced relationship with the Sun."

        "task_content":"How do enzymes help digestion?    Digestive enzymes    An  enzyme  is a type of  catalyst.  A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a specific chemical reaction. In digestion, most enzymes are used to chemically breakdown a specific large substance into its smaller chemical \u2018building block\u2019 components.  All digestive enzymes are  hydrolases , which means they use water to break chemical bonds joining larger molecules together. When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall.      Digestive Enzymes      Each digestive enzyme is specialised to produce one type of chemical reaction which breaks down one specific substance. So our digestive system has many different types of enzymes. Some of the main ones are below.         Enzyme        Location        Substance digested        Product formed          Amylase       Mouth &amp; small intestine      Carbohydrates (starch)      Starch to maltose         Maltase       Small intestine      Carbohydrates (maltose)      Maltose to glucose         Lactase       Small intestine      Carbohydrates (lactose)      Lactose to glucose         Pepsin       Stomach      Protein      Peptides         Trypsin       Small intestine      Protein      Peptides         Peptidases\/Proteases       Small intestine      Peptide      Amino acids         Lipase       Small intestine      Fats and oils      Fatty acids        &nbsp;   \u2018Artificial\u2019 enzymes   Many health issues can affect enzyme function. These include metabolic issues where the body doesn't have enough of a certain enzyme, or problems with specific components of your digestive system (like pancreatic cancer or Crohn's disease) which reduce or impair enzyme function.  When someone is suffering from one of these conditions, they may take a  digestive enzyme tablet . These tablets contain one or a combination of enzymes which help the digestive system to break down food and absorb nutrients.

        "exemplar_answer":"The results from the trypsin experiment provide significant evidence that trypsin effectively breaks down proteins into smaller molecules known as peptides. In our investigation, we observed a decrease in the overall molecular size of the protein substrate when exposed to trypsin, indicated by the appearance of smaller products during the reaction. \n\nQuantitative measures, such as spectrophotometric analysis, revealed a change in absorbance that correlated with the production of these smaller peptides. Specifically, a higher absorbance reading was obtained after digestion, signifying the release of peptides into the solution as the larger protein chains were hydrolyzed.\n\nAdditionally, qualitative tests, such as the Biuret test, further supported our findings; the test indicated a decrease in protein concentration as trypsin acted on the substrate, evidenced by a reduction in the intensity of the blue color, which indicates fewer intact proteins and more caseine breakdown products\u2014peptides.\n\nTogether, these results not only illustrate the action of trypsin on protein substrates but also align with the scientific understanding that trypsin is a proteolytic enzyme specialized in cleaving peptide bonds within protein molecules, ultimately leading to the formation of peptides. This confirms that trypsin plays a crucial role in the digestion of proteins by breaking them down into smaller, absorbable units."

        "task_title":"Forces in action - slides",
        "task_content":"Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm . Measure its&nbsp;height with a ruler  Measure the mass of the toy car (in kilograms) and record it  Place the toy car at the top of the incline and release it. Measure the time it takes the car to reach the bottom of the incline. Attempt two time measurements at each height for reliability of the results.

Repeat Step 7       How might your findings affect the design of a slide in a playground?   The energy of an object changes from potential to kinetic energy when sliding down an incline. The speed of the object depends on the height it is released from. With this statement in mind, devise a hypothesis for your experiment   Potential energy of the car at the top of the incline would be given by:    Gravitational potential energy   = mass (kg) \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity \u00d7 height,  where g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m\/s2   Determine the potential energy of the car at the height of 10 cm, 20 cm, &amp; 30 cm.

        "exemplar_answer":"\"The toy car travels fastest at the highest incline of 30 cm. This is evident from the recorded time values; the lower the time taken for the car to reach the bottom of the incline, the faster it is traveling.

It is made up of a rainbow of different colours and will be  absorbed ,  reflected ,  refracted , or  transmitted  if it hits another object.&nbsp;    When white visible light, such as sunlight or light from a torch, travels from air through water then back into air again, it is  refracted . This means that the light bends as it passes at an angle from one transparent thing (air, glass or water) into another. When this happens, our view of an object is distorted.&nbsp;     Visible light and rainbows     How much a light is refracted depends on the wavelength of the light. The shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. Lights of different colours have different wavelengths, so each colour is refracted by different amounts.

These mixtures are examples of  reversible  changes in that they can be separated back into their original substances.&nbsp;  For example, if we mix salt into water, we will make a mixture. However, this mixture can be separated back into salt and water.

Insoluble substances do not dissolve and remain as visible particles. For example, if I added sand or oil to water and observed that they settled at the bottom without disappearing, I would classify them as insoluble. In contrast, soluble substances like salt dissolve completely, resulting in a clear solution. Thus, my observations indicate that sand and oil are insoluble in water because they do not undergo the reversible change of dissolving.

Map of World Heritage Sites       What makes a world heritage site?   UNESCO uses 10 different criteria to identify which sites are deserving of protection as World Heritage sites. They are summarised in the image below, but the full explanation of each criteria can be found at the link below.      World Heritage Sites - Selection Criteria          The first six criteria usually apply to historical sites (like the Acropolis in Athens), and the last four criteria usually apply to natural sites (like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia).  Of course, an ancient site doesn't need to be recognised as a World Heritage site to be worthy of protection. There are many ancient sites across the world that haven't been designated a World Heritage site but which are still carefully preserved. But the criteria used for awarding World Heritage status is still a useful guide for us when we decide whether an ancient or historical site should be protected.   How do you think the heritage site fits your criteria?   Do you think your chosen criteria point is the most important? Why or why not?   Does your chosen criteria connect to the reasons to preserve ancient sites that you have explored previously? Why or why not? ",
        "exemplar_answer":"Yes, I believe that conserving the remains and heritage of the past is the most important criteria for focus selection. This significance lies in the fact that our historical artifacts and sites provide invaluable insights into our collective identity and cultural evolution. Preserving these elements not only honors the legacy of those who came before us but also serves as a critical reference for future generations. These remnants of our past foster a sense of belonging and continuity, which is essential for a society to thrive. While other criteria may hold importance, the preservation of heritage ensures that we remain connected to our roots, allowing us to learn from history and avoid repeating past mistakes. Therefore, prioritizing conservation efforts is vital for sustaining cultural knowledge and promoting a deeper understanding of our shared history."

        "exemplar_answer":"A centrifuge is a device that uses rapid spinning to create a force that separates substances of different densities. In stormwater management, it can effectively separate solid particles, such as sediment, trash, and organic material, from water. \n\nWhen stormwater flows into a centrifuge, the heavier solid particles are pushed outward toward the bottom of the container due to centrifugal force. This is because, according to the particle model, mixtures like stormwater consist of pure substances (water) and solid particles (pollutants), each with different densities. \n\nAs the centrifuge spins, the denser materials settle at the bottom, forming a sludge, while the cleaner water remains above. This separation process relies on the differences in the physical properties of the substances involved: the density and size of the particles. \n\nOnce this separation is complete, the cleaner water can be discharged or treated further, while the sludge can be removed and disposed of or processed safely. Therefore, centrifugation can be an efficient method to clean stormwater by utilizing the principles of density and sedimentation in particle separation."

If bee populations fall, we would have less resources and we might face more severe famines\"",
        "task_title":"What's happening to bees?",
        "task_content":"What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? ",
        "exemplar_answer":"The decline in bee populations is a pressing concern because bees play a crucial role in the pollination of angiosperms, which are flowering plants that produce a significant portion of the food we consume. Approximately one-third of the food we eat, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts, relies on pollination by bees. Without them, many plant species would struggle to reproduce sexually, leading to reduced crop yields and biodiversity loss. This decline not only threatens food security and agricultural economies but also disrupts ecosystems that depend on these flowering plants. Thus, the decrease in bee populations has far-reaching implications for human sustenance and the health of our environment."

        "task_title":"Why do we recycle paper?",
        "task_content":"Why do we recycle paper?    What is recycling?    The word recycle has two meanings - to convert waste into reusable materials, or to use something again.&nbsp;  Recycling when converting waste is a  reversible change . This means that some materials which are used to create different objects can be transformed back into the original material. For example, glass which is used to make a glass bottle can then be changed back into a sheet of glass, that can be recycled to make a glass tabletop.&nbsp;      Introduction to Recycling      Recycling is important because:    It allows us to reuse resources, some of which are limited or finite    It reduces landfill so that we have less rubbish in the world    It saves energy as making new products uses more energy than recycling old ones    By saving energy, we are also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. This helps to reduce global warming which is causing climate change     Does it use more or less energy to recycle paper than it does to create new paper?   Why is it important that we recycle paper? Give and explain three reasons ",
        "exemplar_answer":"Recycling paper is important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Conservation of Resources**: Recycling paper reduces the need for raw materials, such as trees, water, and energy. By recycling, we decrease the demand for logging, which helps preserve forests and maintain biodiversity. This conservation is crucial as forests play a significant role in absorbing carbon dioxide and providing habitat for wildlife.\n\n2. **Reduction of Waste**: By recycling paper, we can significantly decrease the amount of waste sent to landfills. Paper takes many years to decompose, and as it breaks down, it generates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By recycling, we can extend the lifespan of landfills and reduce our overall environmental footprint.\n\n3. **Economic Benefits**: Recycling paper can create jobs and boost the economy. The recycling industry requires workers for collection, processing, and manufacturing recycled products. Additionally, using recycled materials in production often costs less than using virgin materials, benefiting businesses and consumers alike.\n\nIn summary, recycling paper is a key practice that not only conserves valuable natural resources but also minimizes waste and supports economic growth, making it essential for sustainable community development."

        "task_content":"Separating oil and water    Reversible changes    When two or more substances are mixed together, they can sometimes be separated again into two different substances. This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The \u2018cooking\u2019 of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone.  &nbsp;    Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change?    We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea.&nbsp;  This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate.      Why Don't Oil and Water Mix?      So, is mixing oil and water a reversible change?

Try to make sure that&nbsp; you don\u2019t pour too much so that the funnel is overflowing. Also ensure that you don\u2019t pour the mixture down the side between the filter paper and the funnel as it will cause the oil to go through to your container    Leave for two minutes to allow all water to pass through the filter     Could this method of separating oil and water be used to help clean up oil spills?

        "exemplar_answer":"The substance left behind on the filter paper was the insoluble residue, which could include undissolved solids like sand or dirt. This material was left behind because it did not dissolve in the liquid that was passed through the filter. In the process of filtering, only the soluble substances entered the solution and passed through the filter paper, while the insoluble components were retained. This illustrates a reversible change, as the dissolved substances can theoretically be separated by evaporation, while the residue represents physical matter that did not undergo a chemical change."

This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.       Changes      of State in Matter     There are four main changes in state:     Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid     Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid     Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas.

There are many different tectonic plates and each of them are a different size. Look at the image below - it shows you a picture with all the different tectonic plates and where they are located. Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth\u2019s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of  magma  (molten rock) push the plates in different directions.  This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called  continental drift .  We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant  supercontinent  called  Pangaea . But continental drift caused the tectonic plates to move away from each other. This broke up the continents into the separate landmasses we know today.      How Pangaea Broke Apart       We can see the evidence of continental drift today. The  Himalayas  - the tallest mountain range in the world - was formed when the Indian tectonic plate moved north over millions of years and rammed into the Eurasian plate.

This is called  rust .&nbsp;    R\u00adust is the common name for a very common compound,  iron oxide.  Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker.    Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.    You might have also heard of rust referred to by another name:  corrosion.  Corrosion is the  chemical reaction  that happens when metals break down over time.

By comparing this to irreversible changes, like cooking or rusting, we can see that removing the lid facilitates an observation of a reversible change where the original substance can potentially be recovered, while irreversible changes result in new substances that cannot return to their original state."

        "task_content":"How do we preserve ancient sites?  All ancient sites deteriorate over time. The most we can do is slow time's impact through preventive measures and restoration. But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.   If you could make one change to the site to restore or reconstruct it, what would you do? Why?   Of the digital preservation methods you explored, which one do you think best preserves ancient sites? Is digital preservation a good strategy for preserving ancient sites?   How can we mitigate risks to ancient sites from extreme weather events?&nbsp; &nbsp;   What are the benefits and potential risks of reconstruction?

Search for it on    Google Earth     .   Use the street view function to look around the ancient site.  What threats do you think it faces now or might have faced in the past? Why do you think this is the case? ",
        "exemplar_answer":"Reconstruction of ancient sites can offer significant benefits, including the preservation of cultural heritage, increased public engagement, and educational opportunities. By reconstructing these sites, we can provide a tangible connection to the past, allowing people to experience history in a more immersive way. This can stimulate tourism and local economies, as well as promote a sense of identity and pride within communities.\n\nHowever, there are potential risks associated with reconstruction. One major concern is the authenticity of the site; modern materials and methods may not accurately reflect the original construction, leading to a diluted historical understanding. Additionally, the reconstruction process can overshadow the importance of existing remains, which may be more valuable in conveying the site's true historical significance. There's also the risk of neglecting maintenance or misallocating resources that could have been used for conservation instead.\n\nIn my opinion, reconstruction can be an effective way to protect and preserve ancient sites if done thoughtfully and ethically. It is crucial to strike a balance between creating an engaging experience for visitors and maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the original structures. Prioritizing the conservation of existing remains, and incorporating sensitive reconstruction techniques, can allow us to celebrate and learn from our past while safeguarding it for future generations."
