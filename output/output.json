This allows the denser sediment in the water to fall to the bottom - just like the sand in this experiment - so that it gets left behind in the basin when the water eventually continues flowing. Similarly, the water becoming stagnant allows any less dense substances to rise to the surface via floatation - like the sawdust in our experiment - so that it can be skimmed off the top of the sediment basin.This wouldn't happen if water flowed directly to the waterway in a drainpipe.

        "examplar_answer":"I would expect stormwater that flows through a sediment basin to be less polluted than if it flowed straight into a waterway via a drainpipe. This is because the sediment basin allows for sedimentation to occur, where heavier particles such as sand and silt settle at the bottom over time. In the context of our experiment, the separation of sawdust, sand, and water shows how different densities allow for the segregation of materials \u2013 sand, which is denser than water, settles to the bottom, while sawdust, being less dense, can float and be removed from the surface. \n\nMoreover, the slowing down of water flow in a sediment basin would facilitate sedimentation, meaning that suspended particles, pollutants, and debris can settle out of the water column before it continues into the waterway. This process reduces the overall concentration of pollutants entering the river or lake, thereby decreasing the pollution load compared to direct discharge from a drainpipe."

        "task_title":"Evaporation - when water disappears",
        "task_content":"Evaporation - when water disappears    Evaporation and water scarcity    In the last activity, we learned about  evaporation , a process turns liquid (like water) into a gas (like water vapour or steam).  Evaporation is a natural part of the  water cycle  and it occurs even when temperatures are below boiling. Whenever the sun hits water, the sun warms the surface of the water. This is enough for the atoms in the surface of the water to move fast enough to break free of their bonds, and some water escapes as a gas.  This is a problem. In hot dry areas with lots of sunlight, fresh water from rivers, dams, and reservoirs is evaporated quickly. Even though the water vapour only spends around nine days in the atmosphere, when it falls to Earth as rain it might not find its way into a drinking water catchment. So the more water we lose to evaporation, the less we have available for drinking!     Experiment     We know that water will evaporate when it is heated. We can't stop the Sun from shining - so is there anything else we can do to slow the process of evaporation?    One factor we can control is the  surface area  of water.   Surface area is the amount of a surface's area that is exposed to the environment.&nbsp;    In this experiment, we will compare the evaporation of water from a container with a small surface area (a glass) with a container that has a large surface area (a bowl).     Aim     To identify how surface area affects how fast water evaporates     Materials         1 x bowl    Water      1 x glass    Measuring cup         Method      Using the measuring cup, measure out 50 mL of water and pour into the glass    Measure out another 50 mL of water and pour it into the bowl    Place the containers next to each other and leave them for few hours, preferably somewhere like a sunny windowsill    Pour the water from the glass into the measuring cup and record the amount in your results table. Empty out the water    Pour the water from the bowl into the measuring cup and record the amount in your results table     What can you conclude about the container\u2019s shape and how much water will evaporate?   Many people in hot, dry climates use open channels for irrigating their crops. They often lose some of their precious water through evaporation.  Suggest a way of preventing water from being lost   Using your knowledge of how water evaporates, explain how high temperatures and wind could increase the amount of water evaporating from a surface   Which container had the most water evaporate from it? Why do you think this happened?   Many wells in hot, windy places have a cover over them. Using the information from this experiment, explain why people would do this ",
        "examplar_answer":"Covering wells in hot, windy places helps to prevent evaporation of water. When wells are exposed to the sun and wind, a significant amount of water can be lost due to evaporation, which can lead to water shortages. By using a cover, communities can retain more water, ensuring a reliable supply for drinking, irrigation, and other essential uses. This practice demonstrates how scientific understanding of evaporation can inform decisions that directly impact water conservation and public health."

        "task_content":"How do we recycle paper?    How paper is made    Paper is made when wood fibres are turned into pulp. The pulp is mixed with water, flattened, dried, and then cut into sheets. These sheets can be whitened, coloured, or made glossy, depending on the type of paper that is being created.      How Paper is Made      Recycled paper is made using the same process. But instead of using wood fibres from newly-logged trees, the fibre from old paper is used to make new paper.    Source: Suez Worldwide (2020) - \u2018Paper &amp; Cardboard Recycling\u2019.  Published online at suez.com.au . Retrieved from https:\/\/www.suez.com.au\/en-au\/sustainability-tips\/learn-about-waste-streams\/general-waste-streams\/paper-and-cardboard-recycling   &nbsp;  However, we can't recycle paper forever. That's because the  fibres  which paper is made of get shorter and shorter each time it is recycled. After paper has been recycled about 6-8 times, the fibres in that recycled paper are so short that they can't thread together with other paper fibres to create a new sheet of paper. If you tried to make paper using these fibres, the paper would have holes in it or would tear very easily.  &nbsp;    Create your own recycled paper    Factories that create recycled paper have very complex (and very expensive!) machinery to create recycled paper that looks as good as new.

If the mixture is too watery, tear up some more toilet paper and add it to your mixture  Place the mesh at the bottom of the cake pan\/container. Ensure that the mesh goes right to the edges of the pan and that the edges come up the sides (so you can pick it up by the edges in Step 7)  Pour the mixture into the cake pan  Grab the edges of the wire mesh and pull it up straight after pouring the mixture in. The water will drain through the mesh into the cake pan and the paper mulch should now be sitting on top of the mesh  Once the water stops dripping, place the mesh screen on the newspaper  Knead the paper flat until it is solid and dry  Roll the paper with a rolling pin  Leave the paper to dry    Summarise and explain how we can create new paper from recycled paper. How can we create a new paper sheet when recycled paper is torn and shredded?   Paper fibres need to be long to mesh together to form paper. When you wet and pulp paper during the recycling process, you shorten the paper fibres.  Use this information to explain why paper can only be recycled about 6-8 times.   Is paper recycling a reversible or an irreversible change? Why? ",
        "examplar_answer":"To create new paper from recycled paper, we start by collecting used paper, which is then torn and shredded into small pieces. This shredding process is a reversible change, as the paper can return to its original state if reformed differently. The shredded paper is then mixed with water to create a slurry, where it undergoes a process of pulping. During pulping, the fibers in the paper dissolve and separate, allowing for an even distribution in the slurry. This represents a change of state, as solid paper fibers change into a liquid suspension.\n\nNext, the slurry is spread onto screens and excess water is drained away, forming a wet sheet of paper. This drying process involves removing moisture, solidifying the fibers back into a structured sheet of paper. The creation of this new sheet is largely irreversible, as the original shredded paper cannot be brought back to its prior form. This overall process highlights the transformation of materials, where old paper is reprocessed into new paper through both reversible and irreversible changes."

        "task_title":"How are plant seeds dispersed?",
        "task_content":"How are plant seeds dispersed?    Why are seeds dispersed?    You know that a plant seed is the result of a flower being pollinated, which triggers an angiosperm's reproductive process. You also know that the plant seed contains an embryo which, once it germinates, will grow to become a new plant. This represents the completion of a plant's reproductive cycle.  It would be problematic for a \u2018parent\u2019 plant if all its seeds germinated right next to it. The new plants would compete with the parent plant for light, soil nutrients, and water - so it is likely that either the parent plant or some of the new seedlings would die.&nbsp;  Plants can't move, so they have had to evolve strategies to  disperse  - or scatter - their seeds further away from them. This increases the likelihood that the plant successfully passes its genes on to the next generation.&nbsp;  There are five main strategies which angiosperms use to disperse their seeds.   Wind dispersal   With wind dispersal, seeds are blown from the plant and germinate where they land (if they land in healthy soil). To help their chances that at least some of the seeds land in a place suitable for growth, these plants have to produce lots of seeds.  Seeds that are dispersed using the wind are light and can be carried long distances. Many have evolved shapes that help them stay airborne for longer. Some plants, like kauri and maple trees, have \u2018winged\u2019 seeds. They don\u2019t float away but flutter to the ground. This softens their impact and reduces the chances of the seed being damaged.      How a Vortex Helps Dandelions Fly        Maple Seeds Falling       Water dispersal   Many plants have seeds that use water as a means of dispersal. The seeds float away from the parent plant. These plants have evolved seeds that have hard but light shells that allow them to float down streams and rivers.&nbsp;  For example, mangrove trees live in estuaries. If a mangrove seed falls during low tide, it can begin to root in the soil. If the seeds fall in the water, they are carried away by the tide to grow somewhere else.   Animal dispersal   Animals can disperse seeds both internally and externally.   Internally , animals are attracted to fruit and eat them for food. They also ingest the seeds. Most seeds will survive their journey through the digestive system due to their protective seed coat. They are then deposited in manure far away from the parent plant.      Fruit &amp; Animal Dispersal       Externally , animals can brush up against plants as they move through the undergrowth. Many plants have taken advantage of this by growing seeds as sticky or prickly  burrs  which stick to an animal's fur or feathers. They stick to the animal as it moves away from the plant and, when they eventually fall off, they are a long way from their parent plant.   Explosion   Some parent plants produce seeds in pods. When dry, these pods explode to spread their seeds as far away as possible.      Seed Dispersal by Explosion       Fire   In countries that experience regular bushfires (like Australia), some plants have adapted their seed dispersal to fire. Plants like banksias and eucalypts need the high temperatures of fires to trigger the release of their seeds.  Their seeds are often in cones or fruits that are completely sealed with resin. These cones\/fruits can only open to release their seeds after the heat of a fire has physically melted the resin. The intensity and timing of the fire is important. It needs to be hot enough to trigger the seeds to be released, but if fires are too frequent, there is not enough time for the plants to grow big enough to make new seeds.      Why the Giant Sequoia Needs Fire to Grow       Describe the characteristics of seeds that are dispersed by water, by animal fur\/feathers, and by wind   Explain why seeds need to be dispersed far away from their parent plant   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?   Is there a correlation between maximum time aloft and the distance each seed travelled? Explain your answer using examples from your experimental results ",
        "examplar_answer":"Seeds dispersed by water typically have buoyant characteristics, such as being lightweight and having a protective outer coating that prevents water absorption. These seeds often have shapes that allow them to float on water, which helps them travel across bodies of water to new locations.\n\nSeeds dispersed by animal fur or feathers are often sticky or have hooks that enable them to attach to the fur or feathers of animals. This characteristic facilitates their transport as animals move from one place to another, spreading the seeds to new areas where they can germinate.\n\nWind-dispersed seeds are usually small, lightweight, and equipped with structures like wings or fluff that allow them to be carried by air currents. These adaptations enhance their ability to travel long distances, promoting wider distribution and colonization of new environments."

        "examplar_answer":"Blood traveling to the brain can be challenging when sitting or standing due to the effects of gravity and the body's circulatory system. When a person stands or sits upright, gravity pulls blood down towards the lower parts of the body, which can reduce the amount of blood returning to the heart and, consequently, the amount of blood being pumped to the brain. The brain relies on a consistent and adequate blood supply to function optimally. \n\nTo counteract this, the body has mechanisms such as the baroreceptor reflex, which helps regulate blood pressure and maintain blood flow to the brain by causing blood vessels to constrict and the heart to beat more forcefully if blood pressure drops. If these mechanisms are insufficient, it can lead to symptoms like dizziness or lightheadedness. Therefore, the relationship between gravity and blood circulation is crucial for understanding why adequate blood flow to the brain can be difficult in these positions."

When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall.

        "examplar_answer":"In the trypsin experiment, the results demonstrated a clear reduction in the size of protein molecules, indicating that trypsin effectively breaks them down into smaller peptides. This was evidenced by the measurement of protein concentration before and after the reaction with trypsin. A significant decrease in protein concentration, accompanied by the presence of smaller peptide fragments, supports the conclusion that trypsin hydrolyzes peptide bonds within proteins. Additionally, the use of methods such as chromatography or spectrophotometry to analyze the reaction mixture confirmed the formation of peptide products. These findings collectively provide strong evidence for the role of trypsin in protein digestion, aligning with established scientific knowledge of enzymatic activity."

        "task_title":"Forces in action - slides",
        "task_content":"Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm . Measure its&nbsp;height with a ruler  Measure the mass of the toy car (in kilograms) and record it  Place the toy car at the top of the incline and release it.

        "examplar_answer":"Other than the height from which the car is released, factors such as the surface material of the incline and the angle of the slope can affect the speed of the car as it travels down. \n\nIf the surface is rough, it creates more friction, which converts some of the car's potential energy into thermal energy (heat), reducing its kinetic energy and overall speed. Conversely, a smooth surface minimizes friction, allowing more potential energy to be converted into kinetic energy, thus increasing the car\u2019s speed. \n\nThe angle of the incline also plays a role; a steeper incline increases the gravitational force component acting down the slope, resulting in a greater acceleration and speed. Therefore, both the type of surface and the slope angle are important in determining how fast the car travels down the incline."

So why do we bother protecting them?&nbsp;Do ancient sites have any value for us?&nbsp;   They connect us to the past   Preserving ancient sites and objects is important when they reflect our cultural, social, economic, political, archaeological, or architectural history. This history is important because it connects us to specific times, places, and events that were significant milestones in our collective past.  Visiting these sites provides us with a sense of place, and maintains continuity between our past and our present. It helps us understand how we arrived at where and who we are today.   Social &amp; cultural benefits   A community benefits when its citizens take pride in its history and share a common desire to preserve and share their unique past. The tangible presence that ancient sites provide enriches the cultural heritage of a place and its people. They help people connect with each other and with the place that they live. It makes them feel part of something that has existed for hundreds or thousands of years.   It expands human knowledge   By studying history, we learn more about who we are and where we've come from. This grows our knowledge about our species and civilisations, which we can use to make better decisions into the future. Knowing how ancient people and societies dealt with issues in the past helps us to recognise those same issues in the present or the future. And if we know how people tried to respond to these problems in the past and what worked (and didn't work), we can use our learnings to make better decisions today.&nbsp;   Economic benefits   Maintaining and saving ancient sites creates a major demand for tourism. Visiting ancient sites provides people from all over the world with an opportunity to enjoy something spectacular and learn about other cultures and their histories.  For this reason, preserving ancient sites can make a big difference to a country's economy. For example, close to 15 million people visit the Pyramids of Giza (in Egypt) every year! Many of these visitors would not visit Egypt if the Pyramids had not been protected and preserved.&nbsp;  Visitors who are there to see ancient sites spend money on accommodation, food and drink, and on other local wares. This creates employment for thousands of people. The act of preserving an ancient site and making it available to the public also creates many jobs for local communities (workers, cleaners, tour guides, security guards, etc).   Name a historical site you have been to, or would like to visit one day. What did you like about it, or why would you like to visit this site?   Provide three reasons for why you think it is great that this site has been preserved   Is there anything you would add to this list?

Eventually the&nbsp;pressure in the core was so great that our Sun was born.    Matter farther out in the disc&nbsp;was also clumping together.

This would involve adjusting the height of each planet relative to a reference plane based on their actual orbits. Secondly, we could add the orbits of other celestial bodies, such as moons and dwarf planets, which would provide a more comprehensive view of the solar system's structure.\n\nBy discussing these enhancements with peers, we may discover additional factors to consider, such as the influence of gravitational interactions. Recognizing that the orbits are not circular but elliptical could also lead to further investigations into the dynamics of planetary motions.

        "task_title":"What is the digestive system?",
        "task_content":"What is the digestive system?    What is the digestive system?    All living organisms are made up of specialised cells within specialised tissues which are part of specialised organs. These organs work together to make a system. These  bodily systems  work together to help an organism function.  The primary function of the  digestive system  is to break down food and extract nutrients from it. This is used for energy and to help an organism grow and repair itself.   Digestion  occurs when food is broken down from larger and more complex substances into smaller, simple molecules. The foods we eat contain proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Our digestive system breaks these down and then absorbs and uses the smaller molecules within them for different processes in our body.      How the Digestive System Works      Most humans eat between 1.2-2.2 kilograms of food each day. That's over half a ton of food each year! But because of our digestive system, this food doesn't just sit in our stomachs like a lead weight. It gets digested through five key steps:    Ingestion  (when we take food into our bodies)   Mechanical digestion  (when we chew food to break it into smaller pieces to enable us to swallow it)   Chemical digestion  (special chemicals called enzymes break down food into smaller molecules)   Absorption of nutrients    Egestion  (when we excrete unusable or undigested materials)   &nbsp;    How does our digestive system work?    Each part of the digestive system helps break down and move food through the  gastrointestinal tract  (or digestive tract) which leads from the mouth to the anus.   The mouth   Our mouth is responsible for physically and chemically breaking down food. Physically, our teeth, jaw, and tongue break down food into smaller pieces through biting, grinding, and chewing. This is called  mechanical digestion .  Salivary glands make saliva to help make the food slippery. Saliva ensures food can be easily moved around our mouth and swallowed. Saliva also contains  amylase  which is an  enzyme  that chemically breaks down carbohydrates (like bread) into simple sugars (like glucose). By breaking down our food into smaller pieces through mechanical digestion, the enzymes in chemical digestion can act on this food more easily.   The oesophagus   The oesophagus is a muscular tube that transports food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. When we swallow food, these muscles squeeze the food down through a process called  peristalsis . This massaging of food down your oesophagus is so powerful that you can even swallow if you are hanging upside down.  At the end of the oesophagus is a weak  sphincter  (ring of muscle) that allows food to enter the stomach. This sphincter normally stays closed to stop what is in your stomach from flowing back up your oesophagus.   The stomach   The stomach is a bag of muscle that is lined with mucus. Like the mouth, the stomach has both mechanical and chemical digestion occurring within it. The stomach\u2019s muscles physically churn the stomach contents while  pepsin  (an enzyme) and  hydrochloric acid  chemically break down any proteins.  This hydrochloric acid is very acidic and is usually at a pH of between 1.5 - 3.5. The stomach lining is covered in mucus so that the pepsin and hydrochloric acid won\u2019t begin to digest the stomach muscle itself!  Different foods take different amounts of time to transit through the stomach. \u2018Heavier\u2019, protein-based foods (like meat and seafood) generally take longer than foods with a high liquid content (like fruit).      What Does the Stomach Do?       The small intestines   Food leaves the stomach as a runny, smelly liquid called  chyme . It enters the small intestine, which is actually quite long (about five metres) but very narrow.  The small intestine makes a digestive \u2018juice\u2019 using enzymes produced in the  pancreas  and an acidic  bile  produced in the liver. This \u2018juice\u2019 completes the break down of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  The small intestine is lined with structures called  villi  which increase the surface area through which nutrients can be absorbed.      Small Intestine &amp; Food Absorption       The large intestines   The large intestines are shorter than the small intestines (around 1.5 metres) but are wider. This is where the final part of digestion occurs.  Water and some vitamins are absorbed into the body. Bacteria help break down any remaining nutrients.

        "examplar_answer":"In my model, the parts demonstrating chemical digestion are the stomach and the small intestine. I know this because chemical digestion involves the breakdown of food through enzymes and acids, which occurs primarily in these organs. The stomach secretes gastric juices that contain hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which start breaking down proteins. Then, in the small intestine, enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver further break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This process is crucial for multicellular organisms to extract nutrients from food, enabling their survival and reproduction."

The fin designs were measured by how far they moved through the water in a set time. I accurately recorded the data by timing each test and noting the distance traveled, which showed that the larger fins consistently provided better results."

        "task_content":"Evaporating in cooking    Evaporation    Evaporating involves using heat to change a liquid into a gas. The heat causes the liquid's molecules to vibrate faster and faster until they break free of the rest of the molecules and float away as a gas.  In cooking, we usually use evaporation to reduce the amount of water in a liquid. Words like  simmering  and  thickening  usually mean using heat to cook a liquid - often a sauce - for a long time so that some of the liquid evaporates. When this happens, you are left with a thicker, richer sauce.  Although it might seem like evaporating a liquid makes it disappear, this is actually an example of a  reversible change . When we evaporate liquid, we can catch or trap the water vapour (for example, by putting a lid over the pot\/pan).

        "examplar_answer":"Evaporation is a physical change where water transitions from a liquid state to a gas state. During evaporation, the water molecules gain enough energy to escape into the air as water vapor. The water does not disappear; instead, it moves into the atmosphere, where it can contribute to humidity or eventually condense back into liquid form.\n\nTo undo the process of evaporation, one can condense the water vapor back into liquid. This can be done by cooling the water vapor, which decreases the energy of the molecules, allowing them to transition back to a liquid state. This is similar to the reversible changes seen in dissolving and other changes of state, as opposed to irreversible changes like cooking or rusting that create new substances."

Generally, places found next to a warm ocean will have higher temperatures and wetter climates. Places found next to cool oceans have colder and drier climates   Distance from oceans . Coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas. This is because oceans lose heat less quickly than land, so in winter an ocean will still retain some warmth from the summer sun   Topography (or relief) .

        "task_content":"Light refraction    What is refraction?     If you have ever tried to run in water, you know that your body slows down and can't move normally. The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material; it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called  refraction .       How Refraction Occurs       You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water.        Why does refraction occur?     When light moves from the less dense air to a \u2018heavier\u2019 - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly.   Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air. When using our glass of water example, this means that the light bends once when it travels through the glass cup into the water, and then it bends again when it travels out of the glass cup and into the air.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To observe how the refraction of light affects an image     Materials         1 x A4 paper    Glass      Texta\/marker    Water         Method      On the piece of paper, use the marker to draw two arrows on it.

Why do you think that light travels slowly through glass and faster through air? ",
        "examplar_answer":"Light travels slowly through glass because glass is denser than air, which affects how light moves through these materials. When light enters glass, it slows down due to the interaction with the particles in the glass. This is known as refraction, where light bends and changes speed when moving between different mediums. In air, light travels faster because the medium is less dense, allowing it to move more freely. When light passes through different substances, it can also create shadows, as some light is absorbed or blocked. Thus, the differences in density and the interactions of light with materials explain why light travels faster in air than in glass."

And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? ",
        "examplar_answer":"Bees are crucial for our ecosystem primarily because they are key pollinators for many angiosperms (flowering plants). Their role in the sexual reproduction of these plants involves transferring pollen from the male parts of a flower to the female parts, facilitating fertilization and seed production. Bees are particularly important for angiosperms such as fruits (like apples and cherries), vegetables (such as cucumbers and squash), and many wildflowers. Without bees, the reproduction of these plants would significantly decline, impacting food sources and biodiversity in the ecosystem."

        "task_content":"Light refraction    What is refraction?     If you have ever tried to run in water, you know that your body slows down and can't move normally. The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material; it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called  refraction .       How Refraction Occurs       You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water.        Why does refraction occur?     When light moves from the less dense air to a \u2018heavier\u2019 - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly.   Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air. When using our glass of water example, this means that the light bends once when it travels through the glass cup into the water, and then it bends again when it travels out of the glass cup and into the air.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To observe how the refraction of light affects an image     Materials         1 x A4 paper    Glass      Texta\/marker    Water         Method      On the piece of paper, use the marker to draw two arrows on it.

Why do you think that light travels slowly through glass and faster through air? ",
        "examplar_answer":"Rain on the mirror would not cause the sunlight to refract. Instead, the raindrops would create small reflections and scattered light rather than a clear path of refraction. Sunlight is a source of light that travels in a straight line, and when it hits a smooth mirror, it reflects off the surface. Refraction occurs when light passes through a medium, like water; however, if the mirror is wet, most of the light will still reflect rather than refract, causing a distortion of the reflection but not significant refraction. Shadows are formed when an object blocks light, but in this case, the rain does not change the mirror's ability to reflect light in a straight path significantly."

        "task_content":"Can matter change states?    Changes in states of matter     These three states of matter - solids, liquids, and gases - &nbsp;exist at different temperatures. This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.       Changes      of State in Matter     There are four main changes in state:     Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid     Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid     Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas.

        "task_title":"The reproductive system of flowers",
        "task_content":"The reproductive system of flowers    The reproductive system of flowering plants    To understand the importance of bees, we first need to understand how flowering plants reproduce.  Flowering plants are called  angiosperms  (which means \u2018hidden seeds\u2019 in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds.  In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task.  Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the  stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the  carpel .&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Stamen   There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes:   The  anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced  The  filament , which is a small stalk that supports\/holds the anther    Carpel   There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a  pistil .  The carpel includes:   The  stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called  pollination  and means the plant has been fertilised  The  style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary  The  ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form  The  ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred      &nbsp;  Though the  petal  and the  sepal  are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role.&nbsp;   The  petals  of a flower are what attracts pollinators to the flower. More on this below  The  sepal  protects the flower when it is still a bud, opening along with the flower once it is ready to bloom    Draw a labelled diagram of your flower, identifying the male and female reproductive parts. You must include accurate drawings and labels of the following: petal, sepal, stamen, anther, filament, stigma, style, ovary, ovule   Explain the role of coloured petals, fragrance, and sepals in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?   Why is it important that the ovules are found where they are?   Why is it important for the seeds to be found within the fruit?   Pollen is usually light, smooth, and easy to get from the anthers. There is often an abundance of pollen, and it can be quite difficult to remove from your fingers. Explain how these traits help ensure that pollen is used to pollinate flowers ",
        "examplar_answer":"Pollen being light helps it to be easily carried by the wind or by pollinators, increasing the chances of reaching other flowers. Its smooth texture allows it to easily transfer from the anthers of one flower to the stigma of another, facilitating successful pollination. Additionally, the abundance of pollen ensures that even if some grains are lost or not effectively transferred, there are still enough remaining to successfully fertilize the eggs in the receiving flowers. These traits collectively enhance the effectiveness of pollen in fertilizing flowers, which is essential for sexual reproduction in angiosperms."
