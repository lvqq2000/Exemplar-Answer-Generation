It is named after a substance in a  Dr Seuss  book called  Bartholomew and the Oobleck .&nbsp;    This liquid is a runny goo until you apply force to it, and then it acts like a solid. If you hit it with a hammer, the particles lock together and it becomes hard.    You can roll it into a solid ball in your hand.

What about when you grabbed some oobleck in your hand and made a ball?&nbsp;  Explain your answers ",
        "examplar_answer":"Blood being a stir-thinning non-Newtonian fluid is a beneficial characteristic for several reasons. When force is applied to blood, such as when the heart pumps, it becomes thinner or less viscous. This property is essential because it allows blood to flow more easily through the arteries and veins. \n\nIf blood were more viscous, it would not flow as efficiently, making it harder for the heart to circulate it throughout the body. This could lead to complications such as increased workload on the heart and poor oxygen delivery to vital organs. Additionally, during physical activities or emergencies when the body needs more oxygen, the ability of blood to thin out under pressure allows for a quicker response; it can flow faster to the muscles and other areas that require increased blood supply.\n\nIn summary, the stir-thinning property of blood is advantageous because it ensures efficient circulation, allowing the body to meet its changing demands effectively. This characteristic helps maintain proper blood flow and supports overall health by facilitating the distribution of oxygen and nutrients to cells while removing waste products."

        "examplar_answer":"The Earth's orbit around the Sun is shaped like an ellipse, which is a stretched-out circle. This means that the distance between the Earth and the Sun varies throughout the year. The Sun is not located at the center of this ellipse; instead, it is positioned at one of the two foci of the ellipse. Because of this elliptical shape, the Earth moves faster in its orbit when it is closer to the Sun and slower when it is farther away. This orbital pattern is part of a larger system where Earth, along with other planets, follows its own path around the Sun, which is the central star of our solar system."

        "task_content":"How do enzymes help digestion?    Digestive enzymes    An  enzyme  is a type of  catalyst.  A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a specific chemical reaction. In digestion, most enzymes are used to chemically breakdown a specific large substance into its smaller chemical \u2018building block\u2019 components.  All digestive enzymes are  hydrolases , which means they use water to break chemical bonds joining larger molecules together. When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall.      Digestive Enzymes      Each digestive enzyme is specialised to produce one type of chemical reaction which breaks down one specific substance. So our digestive system has many different types of enzymes. Some of the main ones are below.

        "examplar_answer":"In the trypsin experiment, we aimed to investigate the enzyme's ability to break down proteins into smaller molecules, known as peptides. Our results provided clear evidence of this process. Initially, we had a solution containing intact proteins, which we subjected to trypsin treatment under controlled conditions. Over time, we monitored the changes in this solution.\n\nThe key observations from our experiment included a significant decrease in the concentration of intact proteins, coupled with the emergence of smaller fragments. Using techniques such as gel electrophoresis or spectrophotometry, we could analyze the protein structure before and after the treatment. The results showed a distinct pattern: following the activity of trypsin, we detected smaller bands on a gel that correspond to peptides, indicating that protein molecules had been cleaved into smaller units.\n\nAdditionally, measuring the absorbance at specific wavelengths allowed us to quantify the breakdown product. A notable increase in absorbance at UV wavelengths associated with peptide bonds suggested that trypsin effectively cleaved proteins, since free peptides absorb light at these wavelengths. \n\nBy correlating these findings with the known specificity of trypsin\u2014which hydrolyzes peptide bonds specifically at the carboxyl side of lysine and arginine residues\u2014we could conclude that the enzyme was active and functioning as expected throughout the experiment.\n\nOverall, the evidence from our experiment clearly indicates that trypsin breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. The reduction in intact proteins and the formation of peptide fragments support the conclusion that trypsin acts on protein substrates, resulting in the expected product of peptide formation. This relationship between enzyme activity and substrate breakdown exemplifies the fundamental principles of enzymatic action and protein digestion."

        "task_title":"Forces in action - slides",
        "task_content":"Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm . Measure its&nbsp;height with a ruler  Measure the mass of the toy car (in kilograms) and record it  Place the toy car at the top of the incline and release it.

Repeat Step 7       How might your findings affect the design of a slide in a playground?   The energy of an object changes from potential to kinetic energy when sliding down an incline. The speed of the object depends on the height it is released from. With this statement in mind, devise a hypothesis for your experiment   Potential energy of the car at the top of the incline would be given by:    Gravitational potential energy   = mass (kg) \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity \u00d7 height,  where g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m\/s2   Determine the potential energy of the car at the height of 10 cm, 20 cm, &amp; 30 cm.

At which height is the toy car travelling the fastest? Explain using your time values   Other than the height from which it is released, what else might affect the speed of the car as it travels down the incline? How and why? ",
        "examplar_answer":"The toy car is traveling the fastest at the highest incline, which is 30 cm, based on the time values recorded during the experiment. As the height of the incline increases, the potential energy of the car at the starting point also increases, which is expressed by the formula for gravitational potential energy: \n\nGravitational potential energy = mass (kg) \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m\/s\u00b2) \u00d7 height (m). \n\nFor instance, if we assume the mass of the toy car is 0.1 kg, we can calculate the potential energy at each height:\n\n1. At 10 cm (0.1 m):\n   Potential energy = 0.1 kg \u00d7 9.8 m\/s\u00b2 \u00d7 0.1 m = 0.098 J.\n\n2. At 20 cm (0.2 m):\n   Potential energy = 0.1 kg \u00d7 9.8 m\/s\u00b2 \u00d7 0.2 m = 0.196 J.\n\n3. At 30 cm (0.3 m):\n   Potential energy = 0.1 kg \u00d7 9.8 m\/s\u00b2 \u00d7 0.3 m = 0.294 J.\n\nAs the car is released from higher inclines, the increase in potential energy converts to kinetic energy as the car slides down. The time measurements for each height should show that the car takes less time to reach the bottom of the incline at higher heights. For example, if the time taken at 10 cm is recorded as 2 seconds, at 20 cm it might be 1.5 seconds, and at 30 cm it might only be 1 second, indicating that the speed of the car increases with height.\n\nThus, the toy car is certainly traveling the fastest at the 30 cm height, as the observed time values reveal it reaches the bottom in the shortest duration, confirming the relationship between increased height, greater potential energy, and increased speed down the incline. This observation is significant in the design of playground slides, where a gradual increase in height can provide a thrilling yet safe experience for users. \n\nHowever, other factors, such as friction between the car and the track, the surface material of the incline, and the car's size and weight, could also influence the speed of the car as it travels down the incline. These factors may either enhance or reduce the car's acceleration and final speed during the experiment."

It is made up of a rainbow of different colours and will be  absorbed ,  reflected ,  refracted , or  transmitted  if it hits another object.&nbsp;    When white visible light, such as sunlight or light from a torch, travels from air through water then back into air again, it is  refracted . This means that the light bends as it passes at an angle from one transparent thing (air, glass or water) into another. When this happens, our view of an object is distorted.&nbsp;     Visible light and rainbows     How much a light is refracted depends on the wavelength of the light. The shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. Lights of different colours have different wavelengths, so each colour is refracted by different amounts. Therefore, white visible light is split up after passing from air to water and the individual colours become visible.&nbsp;    This scattering of light allows us to see the spectrum of colours that form a rainbow.

        "examplar_answer":"The substances that were insoluble in water were sand, oil, and some types of plastic. I know this because, when tested, these substances did not dissolve in water and remained visible as separate entities. For instance, when sand was added to water, it settled at the bottom rather than mixing uniformly, indicating that it could not dissolve. Similarly, oil formed a distinct layer on top of the water, demonstrating that it does not interact with water at the molecular level to form a solution. Plastics, depending on their type, also did not dissolve but remained intact. \n\nThis observation aligns with the understanding of reversible changes\u2014dissolving is a reversible change where substances mix uniformly, while insoluble substances simply do not undergo this process. In contrast, substances that dissolve can often revert to their original state if the solution is evaporated. Therefore, knowing which substances are insoluble in water helps identify their properties and the changes (reversible versus irreversible) that occur when they interact with water."

        "task_content":"Which sites do we preserve?  We can't preserve every single ancient site across the world - there are simply too many. So, how do we decide where to direct time, money, and effort when choosing which sites to protect?  &nbsp;    UNESCO world heritage sites    One of the duties of  UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization)  is to identify and protect ancient sites. These are designated as  World Heritage sites . World Heritage sites are places that have outstanding universal value to humanity and, therefore, need to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.      What are UNESCO World Heritage Sites     ?     Check out the interactive map below that shows all the World Heritage sites. How many have you been to?      Map of World Heritage Sites       What makes a world heritage site?   UNESCO uses 10 different criteria to identify which sites are deserving of protection as World Heritage sites. They are summarised in the image below, but the full explanation of each criteria can be found at the link below.      World Heritage Sites - Selection Criteria          The first six criteria usually apply to historical sites (like the Acropolis in Athens), and the last four criteria usually apply to natural sites (like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia).  Of course, an ancient site doesn't need to be recognised as a World Heritage site to be worthy of protection. There are many ancient sites across the world that haven't been designated a World Heritage site but which are still carefully preserved. But the criteria used for awarding World Heritage status is still a useful guide for us when we decide whether an ancient or historical site should be protected.   How do you think the heritage site fits your criteria?   Do you think your chosen criteria point is the most important? Why or why not?   Does your chosen criteria connect to the reasons to preserve ancient sites that you have explored previously? Why or why not? ",
        "examplar_answer":"In evaluating the importance of conserving the remains and heritage of the past, I firmly believe that this criterion stands out as the most significant. The preservation of historical artifacts, sites, and practices provides us with invaluable insights into our collective identity and cultural legacy. These remnants serve as tangible connections to our history, allowing future generations to understand and appreciate the journey that has shaped our societies.\n\nWhile other criteria, such as promoting innovation or embracing modern developments, hold relevance, they often lack the foundational significance that comes from understanding our roots. Without a thorough comprehension of our past, we risk losing the context and lessons that inform our present and guide our future. Additionally, conserving heritage fosters a sense of pride and belonging within communities, encouraging cultural continuity and resilience.\n\nMoreover, the remains and heritage of the past provide a platform for dialogue and understanding among diverse groups, promoting social cohesion in an increasingly globalized world. By prioritizing conservation, we not only honor the legacy of those who came before us but also enrich our own lives and those of future generations. In summary, while there are various important criteria to consider, the conservation of our past is paramount, as it forms the very foundation upon which we build our future."

        "examplar_answer":"A centrifuge is a device that uses rotational force to separate substances based on their density. It works by spinning containers filled with mixtures at high speeds. As the centrifuge spins, the denser particles in the mixture experience a force that pushes them outward to the bottom or sides of the container, while lighter particles remain suspended in the fluid or move less than the denser ones. This separation is based on the particle model, which shows that pure substances have uniform compositions and properties, while mixtures contain two or more different substances that can be separated based on their physical characteristics.\n\nWhen it comes to cleaning stormwater, a centrifuge could be very effective. Stormwater often contains a variety of pollutants, including sediments, oils, heavy metals, and organic materials. By using a centrifuge, we can exploit the differences in density between these contaminants and the water. For example, heavier sediments and pollutants can be separated from the water as the centrifuge spins, allowing us to remove a significant portion of the harmful materials.\n\nIn this way, centrifugation could greatly enhance the treatment of stormwater by effectively separating out the detrimental components, leading to cleaner water that can be returned to the environment or reused. This application demonstrates an understanding of the properties of substances in mixtures and how centrifugation can be applied to achieve separation based on those properties, addressing the challenges posed by polluted stormwater."

If bee populations fall, we would have less resources and we might face more severe famines\"",
        "task_title":"What's happening to bees?",
        "task_content":"What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? ",
        "examplar_answer":"The decline in bee populations is a significant concern for humans and society because bees play a crucial role in the process of sexual reproduction in angiosperms, which are flowering plants. These plants include many of the crops we rely on for food, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Bees are key pollinators; they transfer pollen from the male parts of a flower to the female parts, facilitating fertilization and the production of seeds and fruit.\n\nWithout bees, many plants would struggle to reproduce, leading to a decrease in plant diversity and availability. This decline in plant life directly affects our food supply, as many crops depend on bee pollination. For instance, crops like apples, almonds, and blueberries rely heavily on bees for successful growth and yield. If bee populations continue to decline, we could face reduced crop yields, leading to food shortages and increased prices.\n\nFurthermore, the impact of declining bee populations extends beyond agriculture. Many plants are vital for ecosystems, providing food and habitat for numerous other species. A reduction in plant diversity can lead to negative effects on ecosystems, disrupting food chains and harming wildlife. This ultimately affects human beings as well, since ecosystems provide services such as clean air, water, and climate regulation.\n\nIn summary, the decline in bee populations should concern us because it jeopardizes food security, threatens biodiversity, and undermines the essential services provided by healthy ecosystems. It is imperative to address the factors contributing to bee population decline to ensure a sustainable future for both humans and the environment."

        "task_content":"Why do we recycle paper?    What is recycling?    The word recycle has two meanings - to convert waste into reusable materials, or to use something again.&nbsp;  Recycling when converting waste is a  reversible change . This means that some materials which are used to create different objects can be transformed back into the original material. For example, glass which is used to make a glass bottle can then be changed back into a sheet of glass, that can be recycled to make a glass tabletop.&nbsp;      Introduction to Recycling      Recycling is important because:    It allows us to reuse resources, some of which are limited or finite    It reduces landfill so that we have less rubbish in the world    It saves energy as making new products uses more energy than recycling old ones    By saving energy, we are also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. This helps to reduce global warming which is causing climate change     Does it use more or less energy to recycle paper than it does to create new paper?   Why is it important that we recycle paper? Give and explain three reasons ",
        "examplar_answer":"Recycling paper is important for several reasons that have significant implications for both the environment and society. \n\nFirst, recycling paper helps conserve natural resources. When we recycle paper, we reduce the need to cut down trees, which are essential for producing new paper. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, playing a critical role in combating climate change. By decreasing the demand for virgin paper, recycling helps protect forests and maintain biodiversity.\n\nSecond, recycling paper reduces energy consumption. The process of recycling usually requires less energy compared to producing new paper from raw materials. For instance, it takes about 60% less energy to recycle paper than to create it from trees. This decrease in energy usage not only lowers greenhouse gas emissions but also contributes to a more sustainable energy future.\n\nLastly, recycling paper helps minimize waste and promotes efficient waste management. Landfills are a major source of pollution, and when paper decomposes in landfills, it generates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. By recycling paper, we divert it from landfills, reducing negative environmental impacts and encouraging a circular economy where materials are reused and repurposed.\n\nIn summary, recycling paper is important because it conserves natural resources, reduces energy consumption, and minimizes waste. By understanding and acting on these benefits, individuals and communities can make informed decisions that support a healthier planet."

        "task_content":"Separating oil and water    Reversible changes    When two or more substances are mixed together, they can sometimes be separated again into two different substances. This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible.

        "examplar_answer":"In the experiment, what was left behind on the filter paper was the solid residue, which was the undissolved substance. This residue could have been sand, salt, or any other solid material that did not dissolve in the liquid used during the filtration process.\n\nThis solid was left behind because it did not undergo a reversible change like dissolving, where a solid disperses in a liquid to form a solution. Instead, the undissolved particles could not blend with the liquid due to their larger size and differing properties, which prevented them from passing through the filter paper. The filter acted as a barrier, allowing only the liquid to pass through while trapping the solid particles. This is an example of a physical change where no new substances were created, in contrast to irreversible changes like cooking, where the ingredients become new substances."

For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely.

        "examplar_answer":"To make ice from water, you need to remove heat. When water is cooled down, its temperature decreases, and when enough heat is removed, the water molecules lose energy and start to slow down. This cooling process allows the molecules to get closer together and arrange themselves into a solid structure, forming ice. \n\nIn terms of observable properties, water (liquid) has a different consistency and shape compared to ice (solid). Water flows and takes the shape of its container, while ice holds a fixed shape and is rigid. Additionally, ice is less dense than liquid water, which is why it floats. Thus, by removing heat, we change the physical state of water from a liquid to a solid, demonstrating how solids, liquids, and gases behave differently based on temperature and energy levels."

        "examplar_answer":"In our experiment, we tested different fin designs to determine which one worked best in terms of propulsion and stability. We evaluated three types of fins: a straight fin, a curved fin, and a zigzag fin. To make our experiment fair, we kept certain variables constant, such as the size of the fins, the material they were made of, and the environment in which we tested them (i.e., using the same water tank and conditions for each trial).\n\nWe measured the performance of each fin design by observing how far each fin could propel a model (such as a toy boat) in the water over a set period of time. This was our dependent variable, which we recorded in meters. We conducted multiple trials for each fin design to ensure the reliability of our results.\n\nAfter completing our tests, we found that the curved fin design consistently propelled the model the furthest, averaging about 15 meters in our trials. We believe that this design worked best because its curvature allowed for better water displacement, leading to increased thrust. Additionally, it seemed to provide more stability compared to the straight fin, which often led to a wobble in the model's path.\n\nIn summary, the curved fin design was the most effective due to its efficient shape for propulsion and stability in water, which we confirmed through our fair testing methods and careful data collection."

        "examplar_answer":"To create a bathroom window that allows natural light while maintaining privacy, I would choose frosted glass as the material. Frosted glass is produced by sandblasting or acid etching clear glass, which creates a textured surface that diffuses light. This means that while light can enter the bathroom, the view from outside is obscured, preventing anyone from seeing inside.\n\nChoosing frosted glass is a practical decision grounded in scientific understanding. The diffusion of light through the textured surface demonstrates the principles of optics\u2014how light behaves when it comes into contact with different surfaces. By employing this material, individuals can effectively solve the problem of needing both illumination and seclusion in a bathroom space.\n\nFurthermore, communities often use similar solutions based on common knowledge about materials and their properties. Recognizing the balance between light and privacy is important in residential design, and frosted glass serves as an ideal response to this need. Therefore, using frosted glass in a bathroom window is not only functional but also aligns with scientific knowledge about light transmission and material properties, making it an informed choice for homeowners and builders alike."

        "examplar_answer":"Findings related to the safety and functionality of swings in playgrounds can significantly influence their design in two main ways.\n\nFirst, if research indicates that the height and type of swings impact injury rates, designers may choose to create swings that are lower to the ground or incorporate safer materials. For instance, using softer materials for seats and adding safety harnesses can reduce the risk of falls and injuries during play. This shift would align with community concerns about children's safety, encouraging parents and guardians to feel more confident in allowing their children to play.\n\nSecond, findings could also lead to the implementation of universal design principles, ensuring swings are inclusive for children with diverse abilities. By incorporating features such as supportive seats, wider platforms for wheelchairs, or sensory integration designs, swings can accommodate a broader range of users. This change would reflect a growing awareness and demand for inclusive playgrounds in community policies, aligning with principles of equity and accessibility.\n\nOverall, these findings not only enhance safety and inclusivity but also communicate the importance of using scientific research to inform individual viewpoints and shape community regulations regarding playground equipment."

Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth\u2019s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place.

This is called  rust .&nbsp;    R\u00adust is the common name for a very common compound,  iron oxide.  Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker.    Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.

This would result in a concentration of the remaining substance and potentially create new substances as components react with the air.\n\nOn the other hand, if we had left the lid on Jar 1, the changes would have been reversible, like the dissolving of sugar in water, where nothing new is produced, and the sugar can still be recovered fully. This contrasts with processes like cooking, where the heat transforms ingredients into new substances and altering their original properties permanently.

Write your predictions and results in your results table. You will also be able to include what color you expect the transmitted light to be. You will then use your flashlights to test your hypothesis     Which materials were translucent? How do you know?   Which materials were transparent? How do you know?   Which opaque objects absorbed light?   Which opaque objects reflected light?   What type of materials would you use if you wanted to create more light? Why?   What type of material would you use if you wanted to make a bathroom window where you need light and some privacy? Why?   What type of material would you use to make a pair of reading glasses? Why? ",
        "examplar_answer":"To determine which materials were transparent, I observed how light interacted with them. Transparent materials allow light to pass through with minimal obstruction, meaning we can see objects clearly on the other side. For instance, when I shone a flashlight through a clear glass and a piece of plastic wrap, both allowed the light to pass through without much scattering, making the light source visible on the other side.\n\nI know these materials are transparent because I could see the light travel straight through them, which aligns with the principle that light moves in straight paths. I also noticed that when light hit opaque materials, it created a shadow behind them because they blocked the light. In contrast, the transparent materials did not create shadows because they let the light through.\n\nAdditionally, I recognized that light can be reflected and refracted. When light passed through the transparent materials, it sometimes changed direction slightly (refraction), but it did not stop moving through them. This behavior helps indicate that these materials are indeed transparent. So, based on these observations, I can confidently say that glass and plastic wrap are examples of transparent materials."

        "task_title":"How do we preserve ancient sites?",
        "task_content":"How do we preserve ancient sites?  All ancient sites deteriorate over time. The most we can do is slow time's impact through preventive measures and restoration. But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.   If you could make one change to the site to restore or reconstruct it, what would you do? Why?   Of the digital preservation methods you explored, which one do you think best preserves ancient sites? Is digital preservation a good strategy for preserving ancient sites?   How can we mitigate risks to ancient sites from extreme weather events?&nbsp; &nbsp;   What are the benefits and potential risks of reconstruction? In your opinion, is this an effective way to protect or preserve an ancient site?   How could you make this site more accessible for tourists, without damaging the integrity of the site?   Describe two ways that education can help protect ancient sites   Use the World Heritage site from ancient Greece you looked at in the previous task (when looking at the selection criteria). Search for it on    Google Earth     .   Use the street view function to look around the ancient site.  What threats do you think it faces now or might have faced in the past? Why do you think this is the case? ",
        "examplar_answer":"Reconstruction of ancient sites can offer several benefits, alongside certain risks that need to be carefully considered. One key benefit is that reconstruction can help to preserve the historical and cultural significance of a site, allowing future generations to connect with their heritage. By restoring a structure or landscape to its former glory, it can serve as an educational tool that communicates the stories and contexts of the past. Additionally, reconstruction can boost tourism, contributing to local economies and encouraging broader public appreciation for history and archaeology.\n\nHowever, there are potential risks associated with reconstruction. One major concern is that it may lead to a misrepresentation of the site's original state. If reconstructions are overly creative or not based on solid archaeological evidence, they could distort public understanding of history. Furthermore, the process of reconstruction can sometimes disrupt the original site, causing the degradation of remaining authentic materials or leading to a loss of archaeological context. This raises ethical questions about the balance between preservation and reconstruction: is it better to leave a site in a state of ruin, or should we try to recreate an idealized version of its past?\n\nIn my opinion, while reconstruction can be an effective way to protect or preserve ancient sites, it must be done with great care and respect for the original materials and context. An effective approach would involve collaboration with archaeologists, historians, and local communities to ensure that any reconstruction is both historically accurate and culturally sensitive. Additionally, it is crucial to involve public discourse in these decisions to balance preservation with education and tourism. Ultimately, the goal should be to safeguard the integrity of ancient sites while enhancing public engagement with history."
