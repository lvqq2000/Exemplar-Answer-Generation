        "task_content":"How does rust form?    What is rust?     When an iron object is left in damp air (or water) for a considerable time, it gets covered with an orange-brown flaky substance. This is called  rust .&nbsp;    R\u00adust is the common name for a very common compound,  iron oxide.  Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker.    Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.    You might have also heard of rust referred to by another name:  corrosion.  Corrosion is the  chemical reaction  that happens when metals break down over time. This happens due to factors in the environment. Therefore, rusting is an example of corrosion.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To investigate which substances cause iron to rust     Materials         4 x small containers\/jars    Distilled water      Marker &amp; sticky labels    Calcium chloride      Tablespoon and teaspoon    Vegetable oil &amp; vinegar (or other acid)      Iron filings    Ruler         Method       Label your containers as follows:&nbsp;     Jar 1 - Control (water and oxygen)    Jar 2 - No water    Jar 3 -&nbsp; No oxygen    Jar 4 - Water, oxygen, &amp; vinegar       Add materials to each jar based on the instructions below      Place all filled jars in a quiet place and wait until you see rust in one of your jars (normally within 24 hours).

        "task_content":"The reproductive system of flowers    The reproductive system of flowering plants    To understand the importance of bees, we first need to understand how flowering plants reproduce.  Flowering plants are called  angiosperms  (which means \u2018hidden seeds\u2019 in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds.  In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task.  Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the  stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the  carpel .&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Stamen   There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes:   The  anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced  The  filament , which is a small stalk that supports\/holds the anther    Carpel   There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a  pistil .  The carpel includes:   The  stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called  pollination  and means the plant has been fertilised  The  style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary  The  ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form  The  ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred      &nbsp;  Though the  petal  and the  sepal  are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role.&nbsp;   The  petals  of a flower are what attracts pollinators to the flower. More on this below  The  sepal  protects the flower when it is still a bud, opening along with the flower once it is ready to bloom    Draw a labelled diagram of your flower, identifying the male and female reproductive parts. You must include accurate drawings and labels of the following: petal, sepal, stamen, anther, filament, stigma, style, ovary, ovule   Explain the role of coloured petals, fragrance, and sepals in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?   Why is it important that the ovules are found where they are?   Why is it important for the seeds to be found within the fruit?   Pollen is usually light, smooth, and easy to get from the anthers. There is often an abundance of pollen, and it can be quite difficult to remove from your fingers. Explain how these traits help ensure that pollen is used to pollinate flowers "

        "task_title":"Forces in action - slides",
        "task_content":"Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm . Measure its&nbsp;height with a ruler  Measure the mass of the toy car (in kilograms) and record it  Place the toy car at the top of the incline and release it. Measure the time it takes the car to reach the bottom of the incline. Attempt two time measurements at each height for reliability of the results. Record your results  Repeat Step 5 but make the height of the top of the incline 20 cm. Repeat Step 7  Repeat Step 5 but make the height of the top of the incline 30 cm. Repeat Step 7       How might your findings affect the design of a slide in a playground?   The energy of an object changes from potential to kinetic energy when sliding down an incline. The speed of the object depends on the height it is released from. With this statement in mind, devise a hypothesis for your experiment   Potential energy of the car at the top of the incline would be given by:    Gravitational potential energy   = mass (kg) \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity \u00d7 height,  where g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m\/s2   Determine the potential energy of the car at the height of 10 cm, 20 cm, &amp; 30 cm. Show your workings for each answer   Record the mass of the toy car that you are using in your experiment   State the possible independent, dependent, and control variables in the experiment   How can we use your answer above to tell us how much kinetic energy the car has when it is moving down the incline?   At which height is the toy car travelling the fastest? Explain using your time values   Other than the height from which it is released, what else might affect the speed of the car as it travels down the incline? How and why? "

This visible white light is the only source of colour in our world.&nbsp;    Colour is a result of what parts of visible white light are absorbed or reflected by an object. For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red. Colour pigments - such as paints, dyes, or inks - show colour by absorbing certain parts of the light spectrum and reflecting the parts that remain.        Filters     What about things like coloured windows that can change the colour of objects when light shines through them? These are referred to as  filters.  A filter is a transparent material that absorbs some colours and allows others to pass through them.&nbsp;    A purple colour filter will let through only purple and absorb all other colours.&nbsp;When a blue light is allowed through a blue filter onto a blue object, the object will still reflect blue and therefore appear blue.

        "task_content":"Ostracism in Ancient Greece    Using primary and secondary sources    We often use a combination of primary and secondary sources when we are learning about history. This helps us make sense of a contemporary account whilst also using a later analysis to fill in gaps in our understanding.  In this task, we will look at the democratic process of  ostracising  a citizen from Athens.  Ostracism  was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared.  Let\u2019s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a  secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness).   Source 1 (secondary source)    \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void. Then they separated the names, and the man who had received the most votes they proclaimed banished for ten years, with the right to enjoy the income from his property.\"  Plutarch, Plutarch's Lives, trans. Bernadotte Perrin (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1914), 2.   In this source:     Ostrakon \/ Ostraka (plural ) = small piece(s) of pottery     Agora  = central public space     Archons  = chief members of council     How would your conclusions about ostracism be different if you had only examined Source 1 (a secondary source) and not Source 2 (secondary) &amp; Sources 3 &amp; 4 (primary sources)?

        "task_content":"Shadows    Light &amp; shadow     Shadows are made by blocking light. Light rays travel from a source, like the sun, in straight lines. If a solid (opaque) object gets in the way, it stops light rays from travelling through it. This results in an area of darkness appearing behind the object. The dark area is called a shadow.&nbsp;    Sunlight that travels towards the Earth takes just over 8 minutes to reach us. It travels at nearly 300,000 kilometres per second! When the rays reach Earth, they hit whatever is in their path. If the object they hit is opaque, the light cannot pass through, and a shadow forms.&nbsp;    This is why the Norwegian town of  Rjukan  is in darkness for six months of the year - the light rays from the sun hit the mountain before they reach the town.    It is easy to see shadows on bright, sunny days outside - objects such as trees, buildings and people form shadows in these conditions. But shadows also appear indoors due to artificial light.&nbsp;         Sundials     Humans first began using shadows to help tell the time of day thousands of years ago. They do this using  sundials . The oldest known  sundial  was made by the Ancient Egyptians and dates back to 1500 BCE.&nbsp;    A sundial used the shadows cast by the sun to tell the time of day. A dial would be placed in the centre of a circle with markings around the edge, indicating times of the day. As the Sun changes relative positions in the sky over the day, the position of the shadow cast by the dial changes to align with the different times around the outside of the circular plate. This way you can tell the time by looking at where the shadow is cast, using the markings around the edge of the circle.       How Sundials Use the Sun and Shadows to Tell the Time       The shadows cast by the sun change throughout the day and throughout the year as the sun's position in the sky also changes. This is why the town of  Rjukan  is only in darkness for six months, not for the whole year. In spring anmd summer, the position of the Sun has changed - so the Sun's rays hit the town instead of being blocked by the mountain.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To investigate shadows by making a human sundial     Materials         Open space with concrete or another hard surface    A clock      Chalk    Tape measure         Method      You need a clear, sunny day for this experiment. Check the weather forecast first!    Go to your open area where you can mark your sundial. You will need to visit it at least four times during the day so it needs to be nearby    Draw a small circle (or make an X) on the ground to mark where your partner will stand each time you measure their shadow. It\u2019s important to stand in the same place each time to get accurate measurements    Early in the day (possibly 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM), have your partner stand on the marked spot. Your partner can also raise their arms up and clasped them above their head so they are like the hour hand on a clock    Trace your partner\u2019s shadow using sidewalk chalk &amp; write the time next to it    Measure the length of your partner\u2019s shadow and record it in your results table    Measure the distance from the last shadow    Record the direction that the shadow has moved from the last shadow by noting the path of the sun. (HINT: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west)    Come back at regular intervals throughout the day &amp; trace your shadow again, noting the time next to each tracing. You may want to&nbsp; check every hour but you could also do every 2-3 hours if you want. For example, if you make your first measurement at 9:00 AM, your next three could be at 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, &amp; 3:00 PM     In general, how many centimetres does the shadow move between tracings? What direction does the shadow move across the day?   What is the relationship between the sun and your shadow? How did your shadow change throughout the day?   Create a line graph based on the change in the length of your shadows. You can do this digitally or by hand. Save a copy of it here.  Your graph will need to have the length of the shadow on the Y axis and the times that your shadow was measured on the X axis.

        "task_title":"Why does liveability differ across places?",
        "task_content":"Why does liveability differ across places?    Spatial variation in liveability    Based on your perceptions of liveability, are cities or country towns more liveable? Where would you prefer to live?  Spatial variation refers to differences in patterns between areas or regions. For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas.  These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places.  &nbsp;    Why are cities generally more liveable?    Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities.  For example,  Tokyo  (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them.&nbsp;      Tokyo - City Guide      Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium  density  housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase  congestion  (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel \u2018walled in\u2019.      Singapore - Balancing Density &amp; Space      Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases.      Liveability in the Suburbs      However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is.  &nbsp;    Why are rural areas generally less liveable?    In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities.  This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities.  For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land! This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them.  In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal  wealth distribution . This means that a country's wealth is controlled by the wealthiest and most powerful citizens, who usually live in cities. Either because of neglect or corruption in these countries, regional areas receive limited funding and can't afford the services and facilities that its citizens need.

Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death. But CTE's early symptoms include confusion, dizziness, and headaches, which turn into memory loss and a lack of emotional control, which culminate in a loss of motor function and a faster onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

The force applied to turn the objects around the pivot or the turning force is called the  moment , or  torque .       Turning Forces       The torque or the turning force is calculated by multiplying the applied force (in N) by the distance (in metres) of the applied force from the pivot.

Flowering plants are called  angiosperms  (which means \u2018hidden seeds\u2019 in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds.  In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task.

Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death. But CTE's early symptoms include confusion, dizziness, and headaches, which turn into memory loss and a lack of emotional control, which culminate in a loss of motor function and a faster onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

How do you win their loyalthy whilst extinguishing any threat they pose?For example:Should Tayang Khan be killed or allowed to live? What about his son?What about the other powerful Naiman families? Should they be allowed to live?

        "answer":"\"Students could take different approaches for this task. One possible set of strategies - which is both close to what Genghis Khan would have done and a smart way to inspire fear and loyalty in equal measure - is to:Execute Tayang Khan and his son. Alternatively, the son could be granted clemency, but can't be banished (this would allow him to nurse a grievance and raise an army in the future). Instead, he would need to be given a command in Genghis Khan's army, watched closely by Genghis Khan himselfThe powerful Naiman families could be stripped of most of their wealth (but allowed to retain some). They should be given new roles in the \u2018middle\u2019 tier of Genghis Khan's new society. This show of clemency buys some loyalty, as does allowing them to retain some of their status and wealth. But removing most of their wealth reduces the risk that they can grow too powerful and seek to overthrow Genghis Khan in the futureThe wealth stripped from the Naiman families could be shared with the Naiman soldiers. This might buy their loyaltyGenghis Khan's son could be married to the daughter of a powerful Naiman family. This quda would strengthen the ties between the two families\"",

        "task_content":"How did Genghis Khan unify the Mongols?    Who were the Mongols?     Before we explore how Genghis Khan united the Mongols into a single, powerful empire, we need to explore who the Mongols were.    The  Mongols  were a nomadic, tribal people who lived in present-day Mongolia and southern Russia. They descended from many different nomadic groups - including the  Xiongnu  - who had dominated central Asia since the 5th century BCE.    The climate was cold and dry and the land was mainly open grasslands (which we now call  steppe ); the soil didn't have enough nutrients to grow anything else. Because of this, the Mongols couldn't grow crops. Instead, they lived off the meat, milk, and butter which their herds of goats, sheep, cattle, and yaks provided.      A typical landscape of the Mongolian steppe. The Mongols lived in large circular dwellings lined with animal skins and fur called gers    &nbsp;   They were also skilled hunters; they bred fast, strong horses to help them hunt deer, hare, rabbits, and wolves. They even used  falconry  (using birds of prey for hunting), a technique which some Mongolians still practise today.       Mongolian Falconry      Because crops couldn't be grown, excess food couldn't be stored. This meant there were no Mongol cities or concentrated population centres. Instead, the Mongols were scattered across different tribes, which were themselves scattered across the vast steppes. They moved with the seasons; south - towards modern-day China - when winter froze the northern steppes, then back north again in spring and summer. The different tribes often fought each other for control of the best pastures.     The many different tribes of the Mongol Empire, prior to being unified by Genghis Khan  User Khiruge (2014).

If bee populations fall, we would have less resources and we might face more severe famines\"",
        "task_title":"What's happening to bees?",
        "task_content":"What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "

        "task_title":"Light reflection",
        "task_content":"Light reflection    What is reflection?     Probably the most simple thing we know about light is that it reflects. Reflection is not just the reason we can see ourselves in a mirror - but it is the only reason we can see anything at all! Light, either from the sun or something like an electric lightbulb in this room, reflects off objects into our eyes. This is why we can see the things that we do.&nbsp;    Ever wondered why you can't see anything in the dark? You can't see the objects around you, but they don't stop existing. Instead, the light source that has been reflecting off the object has gone, meaning we can no longer see the object.&nbsp;     Different types of reflection     When we think of reflection, we often think of mirrors. Because they have very smooth and polished surfaces, these types of surfaces produce what is called  specular  reflection, where the light reflects at the same angle as it hits the surface. This is why you can get a perfect reflection in a bathroom mirror, or how can you can see the sky and mountains reflected on the surface of a still lake on a clear day.&nbsp;    However, most objects are not so smooth and polished, which is why you can't see your face reflected back at you when you stare at a pile of loose pebbles. Light shining on rougher objects produces  diffuse  reflection, where the light scatters (or diffuses) off the surface in different directions.       Specular &amp; Diffusion Reflection         &nbsp;   If we needed to add light to a dark outside space, we would need to use a smooth reflective surface. We would also need to find and reflect the  focal point  of a source of light as that would give us the most amount of light in the dark space.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To explore how light reflects off a mirror and to identify the focal point     Materials         2 x small hand mirrors    Classroom lights (do not use sunlight)      1 x index card   &nbsp;        Method      Place the index card on a table and, using one of the mirrors and classroom lights, try to create a spot on the index card. The mirror can be moved into different positions or angles in order to get&nbsp; a light spot on the card. This bright spot is called the focal point    Try making your spot brighter. What did you have to do to make the light spot brighter?    After a few minutes of exploration, have a class discussion to review your results. Was each group able to create a spot on their index card? How did we make it brighter?    Try using two mirrors. What happens to the spot on the index card?    Join with another pair\/group. Using three or four mirrors together, try to create a bright spot on one index card on a table. What method created the best results?     Identify and explain which method gave the brightest light spot   Explain how you were able to create a light spot on your index card   Draw a diagram to show how you were able to get the brightest spot being reflected onto your index card. Save a copy or a photo of it here.  Include arrows to show the pathway of the light from the light source to the index card and label the mirror\/mirrors, light source, and index card.

        "task_content":"What is Newton\u2019s first law of motion?    Forces    You've learnt about forces before. Let's quickly recap some key concepts which you'll need to draw upon across this unit:   A  force  is a  push  or a  pull  applied to one object by another object. This could be something we can see (like the  contact force  of a person pushing a pram) or something we can't see (like the  non-contact force  of an object being attracted by a magnet)  Forces are measured in  Newtons (N) . One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of  1 m\/s 2   (metre per second squared) in the direction of the applied force  We can represent a force by drawing an arrow showing the direction the force acts in. The size of the arrow shows us how big the force is. The bigger the arrow, the bigger the force.  Below, 5N of force is being applied to the right of the object        Forces are  balanced  when the forces acting on an object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, resulting in no change in motion or equilibrium   Unbalanced forces , on the other hand, are unequal or act in different directions. This causes a change in motion by accelerating, decelerating, or changing the direction of an object    What do you think separated your successful attempts at flicking the cardboard away from the stack (without collapsing the coin stack) from your unsuccessful attempts (where the coin stack collapsed)?   Give a real-world example where two or more forces are acting on an object in different directions so that they are perfectly balanced.  What happens to the motion of the object in this instance? How does this illustrate Newton's first law and the principle of inertia?   For the attempt where you  successfully   flicked away the cardboard and kept your stack of fifteen coins standing:     Explain why the cardboard flew out of the stack when you flicked it    Explain why the bottom stack of ten coins remained standing    Explain why the top stack of five coins didn't also fly sideways     For the attempt where you  successfully   flicked away the cardboard and kept your stack of fifteen coins standing:     Explain why the cardboard flew out of the stack when you flicked it    Explain why the bottom stack of ten coins remained standing    Explain why the top stack of five coins didn't also fly sideways     For the attempt where you  successfully   flicked away the cardboard and kept your stack of fifteen coins standing:     Explain why the cardboard flew out of the stack when you flicked it    Explain why the bottom stack of ten coins remained standing    Explain why the top stack of five coins didn't also fly sideways     Create a sketch\/diagram which supports your explanation.

You may need to do some research on launch pad designs to get some ideas as to how to tackle this issue    You will need to draw and annotate each design model so that you can keep a record of which design worked the best     Did the launch pad allow your rocket to launch higher? Explain your answer   Sketch an initial design of your launchpad below. Save a copy or a photo of it below.  Remember - the design  must not  block the end of the rocket so that the canister lid can fly off during the launch &nbsp;   Construct a simple bar graph to represent the heights of each launch of your rocket. You can create this digitally or by hand. Save a copy of it here.  Your X axis will have the three designs (Designs 1, 2 and 3) as three separate bar graphs. The Y axis will have the height that your rocket reached with each launch design. You must include an accurate and appropriate scale for each axis, bar graphs showing accurate data, labels on each axis, and a clear title for your graph &nbsp;   Why do you think we use launch pads for real rocket launches?
