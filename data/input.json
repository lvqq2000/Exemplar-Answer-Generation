        "task_content":"How do rockets work?    How do we get there?     Now that you have selected your planet or moon, let's look at how we are going to get there!&nbsp;    Travelling to new planets or moons takes a long time and involves moving at an incredible speed. This, of course, leads us to rockets.&nbsp;    To get a rocket into space, you must understand how the laws of physics and other forces affect rocket flight. Without this knowledge, you cannot design a rocket to reach the speeds and heights necessary to enter orbit.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    How do rockets work?      Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion     The rocket launching experiment we will do later (using a film canister as our rocket) is an example of Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion \u2013 \u201c Every action has an equal and opposite reaction \u201d. The gas rushing out of one end of the canister (the action) causes the rocket to move in the opposite direction (the reaction). Just like what happens when you let the air out of a balloon!       Newton's Third Law &amp; Balloons       This is exactly how all rockets work - whether you use baking soda and vinegar as your fuel or a chemical rocket propellant like they do at NASA.     How do the NASA rockets work?     These rockets use a pressurized fuel and an oxidizer. The oxidizer is something that allows the fuel to burn without using outside air. The fuel, in a gaseous state, is pressurized because this forces it out the end of the rocket just like our film canister rocket! However, there are a few more parts to an actual rocket.    NASA rockets use  liquid hydrogen  as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The fuel and oxidizer are only in these liquid states when they are in the holding tanks and they can only stay in this liquid state at extremely low temperatures. The fuel and oxidizer are allowed to combine within the combustion chamber and, as they burn, they turn into a gas (gases take up about 1,000 times more space than a liquid).&nbsp;    This causes the intense pressure and is exactly like our film canister rocket. The carbon dioxide builds up and puts intense pressure on the canister so the lid pops off. In the case of our rocket, the fuel and oxidizer burn, are put under intense pressure, and are released through chutes at the bottom of the rocket. This propels the rocket upwards.       Rocket Science: A Short Explanation         Rocket fuel experiment     Getting the fuel ratios right is a vital part of a successful rocket launch. You are going to try and find the most powerful combination of fuel to launch your rocket.    In this experiment, we are going to use baking soda and vinegar to launch our rockets. Baking soda and vinegar react to form carbon dioxide - a gas. When this reaction occurs in a film canister, the gas builds up until it can no longer be contained and the base of the canister shoots off.     Aim     To investigate the most effective fuel combination to launch a rocket     Materials         35 mm film canister with internal snapping lid (clear Fuji ones work the best)    Timer      Water &amp; vinegar    Metre ruler or tape measure      Baking soda    Chalk      Waxed paper or bowl    Paper towel      Measuring spoons    Protective clothing and safety glasses         Method      Place 1 teaspoon of baking soda onto the waxed paper or bowl. Add 1\/8 tsp of water to the baking soda and mix it in well. If you are using waxed paper, carefully use the wax paper to fold the damp baking soda onto itself to help mix in the water    Turn the film canister lid upside-down and pack the inside of the depression with the damp baking soda. (Do not put baking soda where the canister snaps onto the lid.) Pack it tightly&nbsp;    Turn the lid right side-up again for a moment. Does the damp baking soda stay in place? If it stays, move to the next step. If the baking soda falls out, then add a little bit more water to the baking soda and mix it in, but try to add as little water as needed. The baking soda will not need to stay in the lid long    Add 5 tsp of vinegar (1 tsp at a time) to the canister at a time, filling it almost to the top. You need to add as much vinegar to the canister as possible without the vinegar and the baking soda coming into contact when you later snap the lid onto the canister    Go outside to an open area at least three metres from buildings. If possible, find a nearby wall and, using the chalk and metre ruler or tape measure, mark out 50 cm heights (to about two metres high) on the wall    Bend down near the ground on a flat, hard spot and quickly snap the lid onto the canister to seal it. Immediately turn the canister over, so the lid is on the ground, and quickly move away. The other members of the group should start timing and recording while this happens. Wait for the chemical reaction to occur    Stop timing and filming when your rockets comes back down to the ground. Record your results in your results table    Tip: If the rocket did not launch, the lid might not have been sealed tightly enough. (If this happens you may simply see many bubbles coming out of the canister). The rocket may not have launched right for another reason (such as not sealing the lid fast enough). If it did not launch right, try preparing and launching the canister rocket again. You may need a little practice to get used to launching the rocket    Carefully rinse out the lid and canister with water and then dry them    Prepare the damp baking soda and vinegar again but this time use 3 tsp of vinegar    Launch your newly prepared canister rocket as you did in Step 6. Record your results    Rinse the lid and canister with water, dry them, and prepare them as before but this time use 1 tsp of vinegar    Launch the canister rocket. How long does it take to launch compared to the other two launches? How high does the canister go compared to the previous two times?    If you are unsure of any of your results, you can try repeating them (using the same amount of baking soda and vinegar)     Before you start the experiment, predict which fuel combination will be the most effective\/powerful. Why?   5 tsp of vinegar  3 tsp of vinegar  1 tsp of vinegar    Which fuel combination worked the best? Why? Was your prediction correct? &nbsp;   Why do you think the NASA scientists need to be very precise with the amount of fuel they have on board the rocket before take-off? "

        "task_content":"Light refraction    What is refraction?     If you have ever tried to run in water, you know that your body slows down and can't move normally. The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material; it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called  refraction .       How Refraction Occurs       You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water.

When light moves from the less dense air to a \u2018heavier\u2019 - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly.   Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air.

Source 1 (secondary source)    \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings.

        "task_content":"How do we preserve ancient sites?  All ancient sites deteriorate over time. The most we can do is slow time's impact through preventive measures and restoration. But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.   If you could make one change to the site to restore or reconstruct it, what would you do? Why?   Of the digital preservation methods you explored, which one do you think best preserves ancient sites?

        "task_content":"Can we predict which genes someone will inherit?    Predicting offspring traits    In the alien activity in the last task, you used a coin toss to determine the alleles which your alien offspring inherited. But, in the real world, we can predict the likelihood of offspring inheriting certain alleles with greater precision. Using Mendel\u2019s inheritance laws, we can predict the genotype and phenotype of basic genetic crosses.  Before we explore how to do this, we first need to understand how to use  Punnett squares . A Punnett square is a simple tool which helps us identify the possible variations - and the probabilities of each variation - which can occur through reproduction, based on Mendelian inheritance.      Punnett Squares and Mendelian Inheritance      Look at the example below. It shows the alleles from two \u2018parent\u2019 flowers. Both parents have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele.      To interpret this:   Each square is a possible option for the alleles which the offspring flower will receive. To fill this in, you take the letter from the top row and pair it with the letter from the left column. Remember that a dominant gene is always capitalised and always is written before a recessive gene in the pairings (e.g. Bb)  We can see that, in the three of the four squares, a dominant gene will be inherited by the offspring flower. This means that there is a \u00be (or 75%) chance that the flower will exhibit the dominant gene (in this case, the colour purple) in their phenotype  In one of the four squares, the offspring flower receives two recessive genes. This means that there is a \u00bc (or 25%) chance that the flower will exhibit the recessive gene (the colour white) in their phenotype   Remember that we can determine both an offspring's possible genotype  and  their phenotype by using a Punnett square.   A homozygous cross   Homozygous individuals have two of the same alleles for a particular gene. This might be a dominant gene (e.g. XX) or a recessive gene (xx).  If two parents who both have two dominant genes (XX &amp; XX), the offspring will inherit XX as there is no recessive gene to inherit. The opposite is true for two parents who both have two recessive genes (xx &amp; xx): the offspring must inherit two recessive genes (xx).

It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared.  Let\u2019s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a  secondary source .

Source 1 (secondary source)    \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void.

        "task_title":"How are plant seeds dispersed?",
        "task_content":"How are plant seeds dispersed?    Why are seeds dispersed?    You know that a plant seed is the result of a flower being pollinated, which triggers an angiosperm's reproductive process. You also know that the plant seed contains an embryo which, once it germinates, will grow to become a new plant. This represents the completion of a plant's reproductive cycle.  It would be problematic for a \u2018parent\u2019 plant if all its seeds germinated right next to it. The new plants would compete with the parent plant for light, soil nutrients, and water - so it is likely that either the parent plant or some of the new seedlings would die.&nbsp;  Plants can't move, so they have had to evolve strategies to  disperse  - or scatter - their seeds further away from them. This increases the likelihood that the plant successfully passes its genes on to the next generation.&nbsp;  There are five main strategies which angiosperms use to disperse their seeds.   Wind dispersal   With wind dispersal, seeds are blown from the plant and germinate where they land (if they land in healthy soil). To help their chances that at least some of the seeds land in a place suitable for growth, these plants have to produce lots of seeds.  Seeds that are dispersed using the wind are light and can be carried long distances. Many have evolved shapes that help them stay airborne for longer. Some plants, like kauri and maple trees, have \u2018winged\u2019 seeds. They don\u2019t float away but flutter to the ground. This softens their impact and reduces the chances of the seed being damaged.      How a Vortex Helps Dandelions Fly        Maple Seeds Falling       Water dispersal   Many plants have seeds that use water as a means of dispersal. The seeds float away from the parent plant. These plants have evolved seeds that have hard but light shells that allow them to float down streams and rivers.&nbsp;  For example, mangrove trees live in estuaries. If a mangrove seed falls during low tide, it can begin to root in the soil. If the seeds fall in the water, they are carried away by the tide to grow somewhere else.   Animal dispersal   Animals can disperse seeds both internally and externally.   Internally , animals are attracted to fruit and eat them for food. They also ingest the seeds. Most seeds will survive their journey through the digestive system due to their protective seed coat. They are then deposited in manure far away from the parent plant.      Fruit &amp; Animal Dispersal       Externally , animals can brush up against plants as they move through the undergrowth. Many plants have taken advantage of this by growing seeds as sticky or prickly  burrs  which stick to an animal's fur or feathers. They stick to the animal as it moves away from the plant and, when they eventually fall off, they are a long way from their parent plant.   Explosion   Some parent plants produce seeds in pods. When dry, these pods explode to spread their seeds as far away as possible.      Seed Dispersal by Explosion       Fire   In countries that experience regular bushfires (like Australia), some plants have adapted their seed dispersal to fire. Plants like banksias and eucalypts need the high temperatures of fires to trigger the release of their seeds.  Their seeds are often in cones or fruits that are completely sealed with resin. These cones\/fruits can only open to release their seeds after the heat of a fire has physically melted the resin. The intensity and timing of the fire is important. It needs to be hot enough to trigger the seeds to be released, but if fires are too frequent, there is not enough time for the plants to grow big enough to make new seeds.      Why the Giant Sequoia Needs Fire to Grow       Describe the characteristics of seeds that are dispersed by water, by animal fur\/feathers, and by wind   Explain why seeds need to be dispersed far away from their parent plant   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?

        "task_content":"How does rust form?    What is rust?     When an iron object is left in damp air (or water) for a considerable time, it gets covered with an orange-brown flaky substance. This is called  rust .&nbsp;    R\u00adust is the common name for a very common compound,  iron oxide.  Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker.    Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.    You might have also heard of rust referred to by another name:  corrosion.  Corrosion is the  chemical reaction  that happens when metals break down over time.

This visible white light is the only source of colour in our world.&nbsp;    Colour is a result of what parts of visible white light are absorbed or reflected by an object. For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red. Colour pigments - such as paints, dyes, or inks - show colour by absorbing certain parts of the light spectrum and reflecting the parts that remain.        Filters     What about things like coloured windows that can change the colour of objects when light shines through them? These are referred to as  filters.  A filter is a transparent material that absorbs some colours and allows others to pass through them.&nbsp;    A purple colour filter will let through only purple and absorb all other colours.&nbsp;When a blue light is allowed through a blue filter onto a blue object, the object will still reflect blue and therefore appear blue.

        "task_title":"Why does liveability differ across places?",
        "task_content":"Why does liveability differ across places?    Spatial variation in liveability    Based on your perceptions of liveability, are cities or country towns more liveable? Where would you prefer to live?  Spatial variation refers to differences in patterns between areas or regions. For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas.  These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places.  &nbsp;    Why are cities generally more liveable?    Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities.  For example,  Tokyo  (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them.&nbsp;      Tokyo - City Guide      Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium  density  housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase  congestion  (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel \u2018walled in\u2019.      Singapore - Balancing Density &amp; Space      Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases.      Liveability in the Suburbs      However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is.  &nbsp;    Why are rural areas generally less liveable?    In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities.  This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities.  For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land! This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them.  In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal  wealth distribution . This means that a country's wealth is controlled by the wealthiest and most powerful citizens, who usually live in cities. Either because of neglect or corruption in these countries, regional areas receive limited funding and can't afford the services and facilities that its citizens need.

        "task_content":"What is the digestive system?    What is the digestive system?    All living organisms are made up of specialised cells within specialised tissues which are part of specialised organs. These organs work together to make a system. These  bodily systems  work together to help an organism function.  The primary function of the  digestive system  is to break down food and extract nutrients from it. This is used for energy and to help an organism grow and repair itself.   Digestion  occurs when food is broken down from larger and more complex substances into smaller, simple molecules. The foods we eat contain proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Our digestive system breaks these down and then absorbs and uses the smaller molecules within them for different processes in our body.      How the Digestive System Works      Most humans eat between 1.2-2.2 kilograms of food each day. That's over half a ton of food each year! But because of our digestive system, this food doesn't just sit in our stomachs like a lead weight. It gets digested through five key steps:    Ingestion  (when we take food into our bodies)   Mechanical digestion  (when we chew food to break it into smaller pieces to enable us to swallow it)   Chemical digestion  (special chemicals called enzymes break down food into smaller molecules)   Absorption of nutrients    Egestion  (when we excrete unusable or undigested materials)   &nbsp;    How does our digestive system work?    Each part of the digestive system helps break down and move food through the  gastrointestinal tract  (or digestive tract) which leads from the mouth to the anus.   The mouth   Our mouth is responsible for physically and chemically breaking down food. Physically, our teeth, jaw, and tongue break down food into smaller pieces through biting, grinding, and chewing. This is called  mechanical digestion .  Salivary glands make saliva to help make the food slippery. Saliva ensures food can be easily moved around our mouth and swallowed. Saliva also contains  amylase  which is an  enzyme  that chemically breaks down carbohydrates (like bread) into simple sugars (like glucose). By breaking down our food into smaller pieces through mechanical digestion, the enzymes in chemical digestion can act on this food more easily.   The oesophagus   The oesophagus is a muscular tube that transports food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. When we swallow food, these muscles squeeze the food down through a process called  peristalsis . This massaging of food down your oesophagus is so powerful that you can even swallow if you are hanging upside down.  At the end of the oesophagus is a weak  sphincter  (ring of muscle) that allows food to enter the stomach. This sphincter normally stays closed to stop what is in your stomach from flowing back up your oesophagus.   The stomach   The stomach is a bag of muscle that is lined with mucus. Like the mouth, the stomach has both mechanical and chemical digestion occurring within it. The stomach\u2019s muscles physically churn the stomach contents while  pepsin  (an enzyme) and  hydrochloric acid  chemically break down any proteins.  This hydrochloric acid is very acidic and is usually at a pH of between 1.5 - 3.5. The stomach lining is covered in mucus so that the pepsin and hydrochloric acid won\u2019t begin to digest the stomach muscle itself!  Different foods take different amounts of time to transit through the stomach. \u2018Heavier\u2019, protein-based foods (like meat and seafood) generally take longer than foods with a high liquid content (like fruit).      What Does the Stomach Do?       The small intestines   Food leaves the stomach as a runny, smelly liquid called  chyme . It enters the small intestine, which is actually quite long (about five metres) but very narrow.  The small intestine makes a digestive \u2018juice\u2019 using enzymes produced in the  pancreas  and an acidic  bile  produced in the liver. This \u2018juice\u2019 completes the break down of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  The small intestine is lined with structures called  villi  which increase the surface area through which nutrients can be absorbed.      Small Intestine &amp; Food Absorption       The large intestines   The large intestines are shorter than the small intestines (around 1.5 metres) but are wider. This is where the final part of digestion occurs.  Water and some vitamins are absorbed into the body. Bacteria help break down any remaining nutrients. Any remaining fibre and undigested food is stored in the lower part of the large intestine (called the  rectum ) until it is expelled from the body through the  anus  as faeces.     &nbsp;    Modelling the digestive system      Aim     To use everyday items to model the structure and function of parts of the digestive system     Materials         Potato masher (or other implement to crush food)    Medium Ziploc bag      Bowl &amp; plate\/tray    A pair of stockings\/tights      Funnel    30 mL water      1 x 400 mL beaker    30 mL lemon juice or vinegar      1 x 50 mL measuring cylinder    Plain biscuit      Scissors    Small banana or piece of bread         Method     Place the biscuit and banana in a bowl and gently crush both using the potato masher  Pour the crushed food into an empty ziploc bag  Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of water and pour it into the ziploc bag.
