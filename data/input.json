        "task_content":"Flotation, sedimentation, & decanting    Flotation     Flotation  is a separation technique which is commonly used for solid-liquid or liquid-liquid mixtures. It is used to separate the particles of matter that have a  lower density  than the particles of the liquid that they are mixed in.      Density of Matter      Flotation can occur naturally (like when you drop an apple into water). But it can also occur when air or gas bubbles are created in the mixture. The bubbles will rise to the top, and the lower-density particles will attach themselves to the gas bubbles and rise with them. This separates matter suspended in a liquid by bringing it to the surface.  Flotation works best with small particles (which are small enough to attach to an air bubble).   Identify and explain which two properties of sawdust made it easy to separate it from the water and sand through flotation.

There are many different tectonic plates and each of them are a different size. Look at the image below - it shows you a picture with all the different tectonic plates and where they are located. Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth\u2019s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of  magma  (molten rock) push the plates in different directions.  This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called  continental drift .  We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant  supercontinent  called  Pangaea . But continental drift caused the tectonic plates to move away from each other. This broke up the continents into the separate landmasses we know today.      How Pangaea Broke Apart       We can see the evidence of continental drift today. The  Himalayas  - the tallest mountain range in the world - was formed when the Indian tectonic plate moved north over millions of years and rammed into the Eurasian plate.

When this happens, our view of an object is distorted.&nbsp;     Visible light and rainbows     How much a light is refracted depends on the wavelength of the light.

The force applied to turn the objects around the pivot or the turning force is called the  moment , or  torque .       Turning Forces       The torque or the turning force is calculated by multiplying the applied force (in N) by the distance (in metres) of the applied force from the pivot.

But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.   If you could make one change to the site to restore or reconstruct it, what would you do? Why?   Of the digital preservation methods you explored, which one do you think best preserves ancient sites?

        "task_content":"Light refraction    What is refraction?     If you have ever tried to run in water, you know that your body slows down and can't move normally. The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material; it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called  refraction .       How Refraction Occurs       You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water.        Why does refraction occur?     When light moves from the less dense air to a \u2018heavier\u2019 - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly.   Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air.

        "task_content":"How do Newton\u2019s laws explain concussion in sports?    Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death. But CTE's early symptoms include confusion, dizziness, and headaches, which turn into memory loss and a lack of emotional control, which culminate in a loss of motor function and a faster onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is no treatment or cure.      What is CTE?      In recent decades, we've learnt that CTE is likely caused by repeated trauma to the head. It's found most often in people who have played combat sports (like boxing and MMA) and contact sports (like Australian rules football, American football, and rugby). It's even been found in soccer players who have spent years heading the ball.      Inside the Brain of a Suspected CTE Patient      CTE can occur from seemingly-harmless head knocks (like heading a soccer ball) if it happens often enough over a long period of time. But it's thought that the most damaging head knocks - and the ones most likely to cause CTE - are those causing concussions.      What Happens When You Have a Concussion?

        "task_content":"Evaporation - when water disappears    Evaporation and water scarcity    In the last activity, we learned about  evaporation , a process turns liquid (like water) into a gas (like water vapour or steam).  Evaporation is a natural part of the  water cycle  and it occurs even when temperatures are below boiling. Whenever the sun hits water, the sun warms the surface of the water. This is enough for the atoms in the surface of the water to move fast enough to break free of their bonds, and some water escapes as a gas.  This is a problem. In hot dry areas with lots of sunlight, fresh water from rivers, dams, and reservoirs is evaporated quickly. Even though the water vapour only spends around nine days in the atmosphere, when it falls to Earth as rain it might not find its way into a drinking water catchment. So the more water we lose to evaporation, the less we have available for drinking!     Experiment     We know that water will evaporate when it is heated. We can't stop the Sun from shining - so is there anything else we can do to slow the process of evaporation?    One factor we can control is the  surface area  of water.   Surface area is the amount of a surface's area that is exposed to the environment.&nbsp;    In this experiment, we will compare the evaporation of water from a container with a small surface area (a glass) with a container that has a large surface area (a bowl).

The force applied to turn the objects around the pivot or the turning force is called the  moment , or  torque .       Turning Forces       The torque or the turning force is calculated by multiplying the applied force (in N) by the distance (in metres) of the applied force from the pivot.

        "task_content":"Can we predict which genes someone will inherit?    Predicting offspring traits    In the alien activity in the last task, you used a coin toss to determine the alleles which your alien offspring inherited. But, in the real world, we can predict the likelihood of offspring inheriting certain alleles with greater precision. Using Mendel\u2019s inheritance laws, we can predict the genotype and phenotype of basic genetic crosses.  Before we explore how to do this, we first need to understand how to use  Punnett squares . A Punnett square is a simple tool which helps us identify the possible variations - and the probabilities of each variation - which can occur through reproduction, based on Mendelian inheritance.      Punnett Squares and Mendelian Inheritance      Look at the example below. It shows the alleles from two \u2018parent\u2019 flowers. Both parents have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele.      To interpret this:   Each square is a possible option for the alleles which the offspring flower will receive. To fill this in, you take the letter from the top row and pair it with the letter from the left column. Remember that a dominant gene is always capitalised and always is written before a recessive gene in the pairings (e.g. Bb)  We can see that, in the three of the four squares, a dominant gene will be inherited by the offspring flower. This means that there is a \u00be (or 75%) chance that the flower will exhibit the dominant gene (in this case, the colour purple) in their phenotype  In one of the four squares, the offspring flower receives two recessive genes. This means that there is a \u00bc (or 25%) chance that the flower will exhibit the recessive gene (the colour white) in their phenotype   Remember that we can determine both an offspring's possible genotype  and  their phenotype by using a Punnett square.   A homozygous cross   Homozygous individuals have two of the same alleles for a particular gene. This might be a dominant gene (e.g. XX) or a recessive gene (xx).  If two parents who both have two dominant genes (XX &amp; XX), the offspring will inherit XX as there is no recessive gene to inherit. The opposite is true for two parents who both have two recessive genes (xx &amp; xx): the offspring must inherit two recessive genes (xx).

Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void.

        "task_title":"Why does liveability differ across places?",
        "task_content":"Why does liveability differ across places?    Spatial variation in liveability    Based on your perceptions of liveability, are cities or country towns more liveable? Where would you prefer to live?  Spatial variation refers to differences in patterns between areas or regions. For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas.  These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places.  &nbsp;    Why are cities generally more liveable?    Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities.  For example,  Tokyo  (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them.&nbsp;      Tokyo - City Guide      Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium  density  housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase  congestion  (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel \u2018walled in\u2019.      Singapore - Balancing Density &amp; Space      Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases.      Liveability in the Suburbs      However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is.  &nbsp;    Why are rural areas generally less liveable?    In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities.  This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities.  For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land! This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them.  In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal  wealth distribution . This means that a country's wealth is controlled by the wealthiest and most powerful citizens, who usually live in cities. Either because of neglect or corruption in these countries, regional areas receive limited funding and can't afford the services and facilities that its citizens need.

        "task_title":"Forces in action - slides",
        "task_content":"Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm . Measure its&nbsp;height with a ruler  Measure the mass of the toy car (in kilograms) and record it  Place the toy car at the top of the incline and release it. Measure the time it takes the car to reach the bottom of the incline. Attempt two time measurements at each height for reliability of the results. Record your results  Repeat Step 5 but make the height of the top of the incline 20 cm. Repeat Step 7  Repeat Step 5 but make the height of the top of the incline 30 cm. Repeat Step 7       How might your findings affect the design of a slide in a playground?   The energy of an object changes from potential to kinetic energy when sliding down an incline. The speed of the object depends on the height it is released from. With this statement in mind, devise a hypothesis for your experiment   Potential energy of the car at the top of the incline would be given by:    Gravitational potential energy   = mass (kg) \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity \u00d7 height,  where g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m\/s2   Determine the potential energy of the car at the height of 10 cm, 20 cm, &amp; 30 cm. Show your workings for each answer   Record the mass of the toy car that you are using in your experiment   State the possible independent, dependent, and control variables in the experiment   How can we use your answer above to tell us how much kinetic energy the car has when it is moving down the incline?   At which height is the toy car travelling the fastest? Explain using your time values   Other than the height from which it is released, what else might affect the speed of the car as it travels down the incline? How and why? "

        "task_title":"Can matter change states?",
        "task_content":"Can matter change states?    Changes in states of matter     These three states of matter - solids, liquids, and gases - &nbsp;exist at different temperatures. This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.       Changes      of State in Matter     There are four main changes in state:     Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid     Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid     Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas. This might also be called  vapourisation  if this change in state occurs above the liquid's boiling point    Condensation : when a gas or vapour turns into a liquid   There are two less common changes in state which we won't explore:     Sublimation : when a solid turns straight into a gas, without turning into a liquid first     Deposition : when a gas turns straight into a solid, without turning into a liquid first    &nbsp;     &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To demonstrate under what conditions water changes its state of matter     Materials         Water    Metal tray      Ice cubes    Oven glove      Electric kettle   &nbsp;        Method      Pass around ice cubes amongst students.

        "task_content":"Why is the world moving?    Continents and tectonic plates    Earth's continents sit on tectonic plates. These plates are huge slabs of rock that lie under the ocean floor.   There are many different tectonic plates and each of them are a different size. Look at the image below - it shows you a picture with all the different tectonic plates and where they are located. Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth\u2019s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of  magma  (molten rock) push the plates in different directions.  This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called  continental drift .  We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant  supercontinent  called  Pangaea . But continental drift caused the tectonic plates to move away from each other. This broke up the continents into the separate landmasses we know today.      How Pangaea Broke Apart       We can see the evidence of continental drift today. The  Himalayas  - the tallest mountain range in the world - was formed when the Indian tectonic plate moved north over millions of years and rammed into the Eurasian plate. When the two plates hit each other, one was forced upwards. This created the mountain range.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To simulate the movement of tectonic plates     Materials        &nbsp; Paper plates    Plain cookies or Marie biscuits         Method      Place both cookies next to each other on the plate and let their edges touch    Start to gently rattle and shake the paper plate and watch how the cookies drift apart when what is underneath them shifts     If North and South America are drifting towards Asia, which ocean would become smaller?
