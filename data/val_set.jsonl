        "task_content":"How do enzymes help digestion?    Digestive enzymes    An  enzyme  is a type of  catalyst.  A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a specific chemical reaction. In digestion, most enzymes are used to chemically breakdown a specific large substance into its smaller chemical \u2018building block\u2019 components.  All digestive enzymes are  hydrolases , which means they use water to break chemical bonds joining larger molecules together. When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall.      Digestive Enzymes      Each digestive enzyme is specialised to produce one type of chemical reaction which breaks down one specific substance. So our digestive system has many different types of enzymes. Some of the main ones are below.

        "task_title":"Forces in action - slides",
        "task_content":"Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide\u2019s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of \u2018track\u2019 with walls on the sides. For example, this could be 20 cm wide and 80 cm long. The \u2018walls\u2019 of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm . Measure its&nbsp;height with a ruler  Measure the mass of the toy car (in kilograms) and record it  Place the toy car at the top of the incline and release it. Measure the time it takes the car to reach the bottom of the incline. Attempt two time measurements at each height for reliability of the results. Record your results  Repeat Step 5 but make the height of the top of the incline 20 cm. Repeat Step 7  Repeat Step 5 but make the height of the top of the incline 30 cm. Repeat Step 7       How might your findings affect the design of a slide in a playground?   The energy of an object changes from potential to kinetic energy when sliding down an incline. The speed of the object depends on the height it is released from. With this statement in mind, devise a hypothesis for your experiment   Potential energy of the car at the top of the incline would be given by:    Gravitational potential energy   = mass (kg) \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity \u00d7 height,  where g = acceleration due to gravity = 9.8 m\/s2   Determine the potential energy of the car at the height of 10 cm, 20 cm, &amp; 30 cm. Show your workings for each answer   Record the mass of the toy car that you are using in your experiment   State the possible independent, dependent, and control variables in the experiment   How can we use your answer above to tell us how much kinetic energy the car has when it is moving down the incline?   At which height is the toy car travelling the fastest? Explain using your time values   Other than the height from which it is released, what else might affect the speed of the car as it travels down the incline? How and why? "

        "task_content":"The heart of the circulatory system    Heart chambers    You already know that our heart keeps our circulatory system running. Every heartbeat pushes blood from the heart through blood vessels to all parts of the body.  The heart is a complex system itself, with different components performing different functions. It has  four chambers :   The upper two chambers are called the  atria . These receive blood entering into the heart. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, ready to be pumped to the rest of the body. And the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood back from the rest of the body  The lower two chambers are called the  ventricles . These are the \u2018pumps\u2019 that push blood away from the heart. The right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs. And the left ventricle receives newly-oxygenated blood from the left atrium and pumps it around the body        Heart valves    Blood needs to flow in a specific direction in each part of the heart. This ensures that only oxygenated blood is pumped through our bodies and that only deoxygenated blood is sent to our lungs.  To ensure that blood flows in the right direction, our heart contains four  heart valves . They only allow blood flowing in a certain direction to pass through them, and they close after the blood has passed through to prevent blood flowing back in the wrong direction. They're a bit like a door that can only be pushed open, not pulled open - you can only go through it from one direction.      How the Heart Pumps Blood      The heart has two valves between the atrium and ventricle on each side of the heart:   The  tricuspid valve  separates the right atrium from the right ventricle  The  mitral\/bicuspid valve  separates the left atrium from the left ventricle   The heart also has two valves between the ventricles and the largest arteries that carry blood away from the heart:   The  pulmonary\/pulmonic valve  is between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs  The  aortic valve  is between the left ventricle and the aorta, which carries blood to the body     Bioninja, Heart Structure (2019).

It is made up of a rainbow of different colours and will be  absorbed ,  reflected ,  refracted , or  transmitted  if it hits another object.&nbsp;    When white visible light, such as sunlight or light from a torch, travels from air through water then back into air again, it is  refracted . This means that the light bends as it passes at an angle from one transparent thing (air, glass or water) into another. When this happens, our view of an object is distorted.&nbsp;     Visible light and rainbows     How much a light is refracted depends on the wavelength of the light. The shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. Lights of different colours have different wavelengths, so each colour is refracted by different amounts. Therefore, white visible light is split up after passing from air to water and the individual colours become visible.&nbsp;    This scattering of light allows us to see the spectrum of colours that form a rainbow.       How Rainbows Form       We will be looking more at how refraction works more later on.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To split white visible light into its colours     Materials         Glass    Water      Sunlight or a small torch (not an LED light)    1 x A3\/A4 paper      Access to a darkened space   &nbsp;        Method      Fill the glass almost to the top with water    If you are using a torch, place the glass of water on the white piece of paper, and move the torch around until you see a rainbow on the piece of paper    If you are using sunlight, place the glass so that the sun shines directly through the water, onto a sheet of white paper underneath it or on the floor if it is on a table    Adjust the paper and the glass until a rainbow forms on the paper    Try holding the glass of water at different heights and angles to see if it has a different effect     Draw how you made your rainbow appear.

        "task_content":"Solubility in water    What is a mixture?    Some solids, liquids, and gases in the world are  mixtures . They are made up of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. These mixtures are examples of  reversible  changes in that they can be separated back into their original substances.&nbsp;  For example, if we mix salt into water, we will make a mixture. However, this mixture can be separated back into salt and water. This can be done by evaporating the water, which leaves behind the salt.&nbsp;   Mixtures &amp; solubility   If a substance can dissolve in water, we can say it is  soluble . If a substance cannot dissolve in water, it is  insoluble .&nbsp;  Some insoluble substances will sink to the bottom and some will float to the top. Some will do both while others are suspended in the water.&nbsp;  For example, when you swim in the ocean you can't see chunks of salt in the water, even though you know that the sea is salty.

Map of World Heritage Sites       What makes a world heritage site?   UNESCO uses 10 different criteria to identify which sites are deserving of protection as World Heritage sites. They are summarised in the image below, but the full explanation of each criteria can be found at the link below.      World Heritage Sites - Selection Criteria          The first six criteria usually apply to historical sites (like the Acropolis in Athens), and the last four criteria usually apply to natural sites (like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia).  Of course, an ancient site doesn't need to be recognised as a World Heritage site to be worthy of protection. There are many ancient sites across the world that haven't been designated a World Heritage site but which are still carefully preserved. But the criteria used for awarding World Heritage status is still a useful guide for us when we decide whether an ancient or historical site should be protected.

If bee populations fall, we would have less resources and we might face more severe famines\"",
        "task_title":"What's happening to bees?",
        "task_content":"What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "

        "task_content":"Separating oil and water    Reversible changes    When two or more substances are mixed together, they can sometimes be separated again into two different substances. This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The \u2018cooking\u2019 of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone.  &nbsp;    Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change?    We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea.&nbsp;  This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate.      Why Don't Oil and Water Mix?      So, is mixing oil and water a reversible change? Or, once mixed, can we never separate them again?  &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To use filtering to separate a mixture     Materials         Oil and water mixture (from previous task)    Another glass\/jar or clear plastic cup      Small funnel    Water      Filter paper or coffee filter (to fit funnel)   &nbsp;        Method      Make a cone with your filter paper.

Moisten the filter paper with a little water to make it stick to the sides of the funnel    Place the funnel in the empty glass\/jar or cup    Carefully pour a small amount of the oil and water mixture into the funnel. Try to make sure that&nbsp; you don\u2019t pour too much so that the funnel is overflowing. Also ensure that you don\u2019t pour the mixture down the side between the filter paper and the funnel as it will cause the oil to go through to your container    Leave for two minutes to allow all water to pass through the filter     Could this method of separating oil and water be used to help clean up oil spills?

        "task_content":"How do Newton\u2019s laws explain concussion in sports?    Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death. But CTE's early symptoms include confusion, dizziness, and headaches, which turn into memory loss and a lack of emotional control, which culminate in a loss of motor function and a faster onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is no treatment or cure.      What is CTE?      In recent decades, we've learnt that CTE is likely caused by repeated trauma to the head. It's found most often in people who have played combat sports (like boxing and MMA) and contact sports (like Australian rules football, American football, and rugby). It's even been found in soccer players who have spent years heading the ball.      Inside the Brain of a Suspected CTE Patient      CTE can occur from seemingly-harmless head knocks (like heading a soccer ball) if it happens often enough over a long period of time. But it's thought that the most damaging head knocks - and the ones most likely to cause CTE - are those causing concussions.      What Happens When You Have a Concussion?       Explain the impact on the brain from head trauma using Newton's first law  Remember that the brain floats inside your skull, suspended within cerebrospinal fluid   We're only just beginning to learn about the causes and devastating impacts of CTE.  How are researchers attempting to develop and validate new scientific knowledge in this field? How will this help us understand how to prevent, diagnose, or better treat CTE?   In some contact sports (like American football), athletes wear helmets to protect their heads from trauma.  Helmets work by spreading the impact of a head knock over a longer period of time. The hard shell of the helmet and the soft padding inside it absorb some of the impact, meaning that your head's change in motion - caused by the impact - happens less suddenly.  Explain:   How this reduces the likelihood of concussion using Newton's second law  How this reduces the likelihood of  any  brain injury using Newton's first law  How this reduces the likelihood of multiple brain injuries  from the same trauma  using Newton's third law    Using Newton's second law, explain two reasons why concussions are more common in men's contact sports than in women's contact sports   Explain the impact on the brain from head trauma using Newton's first law.

This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas.

There are many different tectonic plates and each of them are a different size. Look at the image below - it shows you a picture with all the different tectonic plates and where they are located. Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth\u2019s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of  magma  (molten rock) push the plates in different directions.  This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called  continental drift .  We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant  supercontinent  called  Pangaea . But continental drift caused the tectonic plates to move away from each other. This broke up the continents into the separate landmasses we know today.      How Pangaea Broke Apart       We can see the evidence of continental drift today. The  Himalayas  - the tallest mountain range in the world - was formed when the Indian tectonic plate moved north over millions of years and rammed into the Eurasian plate.

        "task_content":"How did Genghis Khan unify the Mongols?    Who were the Mongols?     Before we explore how Genghis Khan united the Mongols into a single, powerful empire, we need to explore who the Mongols were.    The  Mongols  were a nomadic, tribal people who lived in present-day Mongolia and southern Russia. They descended from many different nomadic groups - including the  Xiongnu  - who had dominated central Asia since the 5th century BCE.    The climate was cold and dry and the land was mainly open grasslands (which we now call  steppe ); the soil didn't have enough nutrients to grow anything else. Because of this, the Mongols couldn't grow crops. Instead, they lived off the meat, milk, and butter which their herds of goats, sheep, cattle, and yaks provided.      A typical landscape of the Mongolian steppe. The Mongols lived in large circular dwellings lined with animal skins and fur called gers    &nbsp;   They were also skilled hunters; they bred fast, strong horses to help them hunt deer, hare, rabbits, and wolves. They even used  falconry  (using birds of prey for hunting), a technique which some Mongolians still practise today.       Mongolian Falconry      Because crops couldn't be grown, excess food couldn't be stored. This meant there were no Mongol cities or concentrated population centres. Instead, the Mongols were scattered across different tribes, which were themselves scattered across the vast steppes. They moved with the seasons; south - towards modern-day China - when winter froze the northern steppes, then back north again in spring and summer. The different tribes often fought each other for control of the best pastures.     The many different tribes of the Mongol Empire, prior to being unified by Genghis Khan  User Khiruge (2014).

You're one of his trusted advisors. You know that:   The Naiman ruler - Tayang Khan - has plotted against Genghis Khan for decades. Tayang Khan also has a military-age son (Kuchlug)  The Naiman tribe has significant wealth that Genghis Khan has now won for himself. But this wealth was mainly owned by the powerful Naiman families. Most of the Naiman fighters are very poor  The next-most powerful Naiman family has a daughter of marriageable age. One of Genghis Khan's sons is also of marriageable age and does not yet have a bride   What advice would you give Genghis Khan on what to do with the Naimans? How do you win their loyalthy whilst extinguishing any threat they pose?  For example:   Should Tayang Khan be killed or allowed to live? What about his son?  What about the other powerful Naiman families? Should they be allowed to live? If so, should they keep their wealth or have it stripped completely?  What could you do to win the support and loyalty of the Naiman soldiers?  How could you forge an alliance with any of the remaining powerful Naiman families to win their loyalty and reduce the chance of a rebellion?   Discuss this with your team.

Their lands are divided into regions under the control of various leaders.\u201d     Sima Qian. Shiji 110: The Account of the Xiongnu      Which similarities can you identify between the Xiongnu and the Mongols, who emerged over 1000 years later?     Build your own ger   The Mongols lived in circular  gers  (also called  yurts ). They were quick to set up and collapse, allowing them to be easily transported as each tribe moved across the steppes. The sloped roof allowed snow and rain to run off it. And it was lined with animal furs and skins to keep the warmth in.      Building a Yurt       Your teacher will give you some simple materials. Using the above video and inspiration (and other videos or photos you find online), create your own model of a ger.    Once you're done, save a photo of it here. Label or add notes to it to explain why they were shaped and built this way    Read the below source.

Mongol sources suggest that conflict between Tem\u00fcjin and Jamukha arose from the different ways they treated their followers. Jamukha favoured and promoted his family, while Tem\u00fcjin believed in a  meritocracy . He shared the spoils of his conquests among his men and rewarded bravery and skill.

However, there is a risk that you change the site too much so it no longer resembles what it used to look like.

        "task_title":"How do we preserve ancient sites?",
        "task_content":"How do we preserve ancient sites?  All ancient sites deteriorate over time. The most we can do is slow time's impact through preventive measures and restoration. But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.   If you could make one change to the site to restore or reconstruct it, what would you do? Why?   Of the digital preservation methods you explored, which one do you think best preserves ancient sites? Is digital preservation a good strategy for preserving ancient sites?   How can we mitigate risks to ancient sites from extreme weather events?&nbsp; &nbsp;   What are the benefits and potential risks of reconstruction? In your opinion, is this an effective way to protect or preserve an ancient site?   How could you make this site more accessible for tourists, without damaging the integrity of the site?   Describe two ways that education can help protect ancient sites   Use the World Heritage site from ancient Greece you looked at in the previous task (when looking at the selection criteria). Search for it on    Google Earth     .   Use the street view function to look around the ancient site.  What threats do you think it faces now or might have faced in the past? Why do you think this is the case? "
