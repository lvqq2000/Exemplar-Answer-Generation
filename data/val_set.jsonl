The push is an unbalanced force that battles friction from the air resistance and then the pull of gravity, which works to pull the swing toward the ground on its downward trajectory. Experimental protocol (Part A) Aim To investigate how changing the length affects how fast the pendulum oscillates Background information A pendulum consists of a mass (m) hanging from a string of length (L) and swings while fixed to a pivot point (P). Swings in the playground can be compared to pendulums and the factors affecting the behaviour of pendulums can be considered when designing swings in playgrounds. Materials Weights (at least 100g) Retort stand string Stopwatch or timer Protractor ruler Method Tie the 100-gram mass to the string and tie the other end to the retort stand. While hanging from the retort stand the pendulum should measure 40 cm in length Pull the pendulum to one side, making an angle of 20 degrees to the vertical (upright shaft of the retort stand) Release the pendulum and measure the time it takes for 10 oscillations (back forth). Repeat this step and compare your results from both tests Decrease the length of the pendulum to 20 cm and repeat the steps above. Ensure that you release the pendulum when the string is making the same angle with the vertical as in Step 2. Repeat this step and compare your results from both tests How might your findings affect the design of a swing in a playground Use your results to explain how increasing the mass of the pendulum affects its time of oscillation Are the forces acting on the mass and the string balanced at the point when the pendulum is not moving but just hanging from the retort stand Explain State the possible independent, dependent, and control variables in the experiment Why does your pendulum eventually stop Refer to forces in your answer How does decreasing the length of the pendulum affect its time per oscillation Why What type of force acts on the 100g mass when it is hanging from the string Calculate the amount of force that acts on the 100g mass Using the variables stated above, devise a hypothesis for your experiment before you start it. A hypothesis is an educated guess of what will happen in the experiment Name the force that is present in the string when tied to the 100g mass.

Every heartbeat pushes blood from the heart through blood vessels to all parts of the body. The heart is a complex system itself, with different components performing different functions. It has four chambers : The upper two chambers are called the atria . These receive blood entering into the heart. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, ready to be pumped to the rest of the body. And the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood back from the rest of the body The lower two chambers are called the ventricles . These are the \u2018pumps\u2019 that push blood away from the heart. The right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs. And the left ventricle receives newly-oxygenated blood from the left atrium and pumps it around the body Heart valves Blood needs to flow in a specific direction in each part of the heart. This ensures that only oxygenated blood is pumped through our bodies and that only deoxygenated blood is sent to our lungs. To ensure that blood flows in the right direction, our heart contains four heart valves . They only allow blood flowing in a certain direction to pass through them, and they close after the blood has passed through to prevent blood flowing back in the wrong direction. They're a bit like a door that can only be pushed open, not pulled open - you can only go through it from one direction. How the Heart Pumps Blood The heart has two valves between the atrium and ventricle on each side of the heart: The tricuspid valve separates the right atrium from the right ventricle The mitral/bicuspid valve separates the left atrium from the left ventricle The heart also has two valves between the ventricles and the largest arteries that carry blood away from the heart: The pulmonary/pulmonic valve is between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs The aortic valve is between the left ventricle and the aorta, which carries blood to the body Bioninja, Heart Structure (2019).

The Earth's orbit Our Earth revolves or orbits around the Sun every 365 and \u00bc days. This extra \u00bc of a day adds up to a full day every 4 years (\u00bc + \u00bc+ \u00bc + \u00bc = 1) and is why we have a leap year with an extra day every 4 years.

The heat causes the liquid's molecules to vibrate faster and faster until they break free of the rest of the molecules and float away as a gas.

Words like simmering and thickening usually mean using heat to cook a liquid - often a sauce - for a long time so that some of the liquid evaporates. When this happens, you are left with a thicker, richer sauce. Although it might seem like evaporating a liquid makes it disappear, this is actually an example of a reversible change .

This is called a reversible change . A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt. We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism. Reversible changes can also occur when the state of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate. Irreversible changes When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them. For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The \u2018cooking\u2019 of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone. Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea. This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate. Why Don't Oil and Water Mix So, is mixing oil and water a reversible change Or, once mixed, can we never separate them again Experiment Aim To use filtering to separate a mixture Materials Oil and water mixture (from previous task) Another glass/jar or clear plastic cup Small funnel Water Filter paper or coffee filter (to fit funnel) Method Make a cone with your filter paper.

This means that they can change state - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough. For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid - when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases. Changes of state in matter occurs when heat energy is transferred to or from the matter. The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy). When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.

It was both an environmental and human disaster. The Deepwater Horizon Disaster Source : Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2021) - \"Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010: path of the oil\".

Direct contact with oil harms every organism in its path. For example, when oil cakes the feathers of a bird, it stops their feathers from repelling water. Oil also weighs down the bird, preventing it from flying. If the oil isn\u2019t cleaned off the bird, it will die. Many birds also swallow deadly amounts of oil trying to clean their feathers. The same is true for marine mammals. Fur acts as an insulator to keep the animal warm in the coldest waters. When oil saturates the fur, it ruins the ability of the fur to retain heat. Marine mammals can also be poisoned when they swallow the oil. As oil floats on top of water, it blocks the sun and stops it from going into the water. Aquatic plants are the same as land plants - they need the sun to make their own food through photosynthesis. If you block the sun from getting to these aquatic plants, they can\u2019t make their own food and they die. This results in less food for any aquatic animals that eat these plants.

These organs work together to make a system. These bodily systems work together to help an organism function. The primary function of the digestive system is to break down food and extract nutrients from it. This is used for energy and to help an organism grow and repair itself. Digestion occurs when food is broken down from larger and more complex substances into smaller, simple molecules. The foods we eat contain proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Our digestive system breaks these down and then absorbs and uses the smaller molecules within them for different processes in our body. How the Digestive System Works Most humans eat between 1.2-2.2 kilograms of food each day. That's over half a ton of food each year But because of our digestive system, this food doesn't just sit in our stomachs like a lead weight. It gets digested through five key steps: Ingestion (when we take food into our bodies) Mechanical digestion (when we chew food to break it into smaller pieces to enable us to swallow it) Chemical digestion (special chemicals called enzymes break down food into smaller molecules) Absorption of nutrients Egestion (when we excrete unusable or undigested materials) How does our digestive system work Each part of the digestive system helps break down and move food through the gastrointestinal tract (or digestive tract) which leads from the mouth to the anus. The mouth Our mouth is responsible for physically and chemically breaking down food. Physically, our teeth, jaw, and tongue break down food into smaller pieces through biting, grinding, and chewing. This is called mechanical digestion . Salivary glands make saliva to help make the food slippery. Saliva ensures food can be easily moved around our mouth and swallowed. Saliva also contains amylase which is an enzyme that chemically breaks down carbohydrates (like bread) into simple sugars (like glucose). By breaking down our food into smaller pieces through mechanical digestion, the enzymes in chemical digestion can act on this food more easily. The oesophagus The oesophagus is a muscular tube that transports food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. When we swallow food, these muscles squeeze the food down through a process called peristalsis . This massaging of food down your oesophagus is so powerful that you can even swallow if you are hanging upside down. At the end of the oesophagus is a weak sphincter (ring of muscle) that allows food to enter the stomach. This sphincter normally stays closed to stop what is in your stomach from flowing back up your oesophagus. The stomach The stomach is a bag of muscle that is lined with mucus. Like the mouth, the stomach has both mechanical and chemical digestion occurring within it. The stomach\u2019s muscles physically churn the stomach contents while pepsin (an enzyme) and hydrochloric acid chemically break down any proteins. This hydrochloric acid is very acidic and is usually at a pH of between 1.5 - 3.5. The stomach lining is covered in mucus so that the pepsin and hydrochloric acid won\u2019t begin to digest the stomach muscle itself Different foods take different amounts of time to transit through the stomach. \u2018Heavier\u2019, protein-based foods (like meat and seafood) generally take longer than foods with a high liquid content (like fruit). What Does the Stomach Do The small intestines Food leaves the stomach as a runny, smelly liquid called chyme . It enters the small intestine, which is actually quite long (about five metres) but very narrow. The small intestine makes a digestive \u2018juice\u2019 using enzymes produced in the pancreas and an acidic bile produced in the liver. This \u2018juice\u2019 completes the break down of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The small intestine is lined with structures called villi which increase the surface area through which nutrients can be absorbed. Small Intestine Food Absorption The large intestines The large intestines are shorter than the small intestines (around 1.5 metres) but are wider. This is where the final part of digestion occurs. Water and some vitamins are absorbed into the body. Bacteria help break down any remaining nutrients. Any remaining fibre and undigested food is stored in the lower part of the large intestine (called the rectum ) until it is expelled from the body through the anus as faeces. Modelling the digestive system Aim To use everyday items to model the structure and function of parts of the digestive system Materials Potato masher (or other implement to crush food) Medium Ziploc bag Bowl plate/tray A pair of stockings/tights Funnel 30 mL water 1 x 400 mL beaker 30 mL lemon juice or vinegar 1 x 50 mL measuring cylinder Plain biscuit Scissors Small banana or piece of bread Method Place the biscuit and banana in a bowl and gently crush both using the potato masher Pour the crushed food into an empty ziploc bag Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of water and pour it into the ziploc bag. The water represents saliva Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of the lemon juice or vinegar Pour the lemon juice or vinegar into the bag. This fluid represents the stomach acid. Make sure there is no air in the bag and seal it Squeeze the bag for about a minute, further crushing up the biscuits and banana. This represents the mechanical digestion inside the stomach Once the stomach contents feel like a thick liquid, cut a small hole in the one corner and carefully squeeze it into the open leg of the tights (small intestine) Hold the tights over the tray or a bowl and gently squeeze the liquid out. The liquid on the tray represents the nutrients the body absorbs and uses Keep squeezing until no more liquid comes out. The food left behind in the tights represents waste products that cannot be absorbed Cut a hole in the bottom of the tights and squeeze the contents into the jar.

For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas. These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places. Why are cities generally more liveable Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities. For example, Tokyo (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them. Tokyo - City Guide Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium density housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase congestion (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel \u2018walled in\u2019. Singapore - Balancing Density Space Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases. Liveability in the Suburbs However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is. Why are rural areas generally less liveable In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities. This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities. For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them. In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal wealth distribution . This means that a country's wealth is controlled by the wealthiest and most powerful citizens, who usually live in cities. Either because of neglect or corruption in these countries, regional areas receive limited funding and can't afford the services and facilities that its citizens need.

Enzymes are the catalysts that speed up these chemical reactions. But these enzymes don't always work at peak effectiveness. They work best in a very specific set of conditions. Temperature Chemical reactions generally work faster at higher temperatures. This is because molecules move faster as temperatures increase, so there are more molecules moving fast enough to encounter and react with each other. However, with enzymes there are upper limits. You can't just keep increasing the temperature forever to get faster and faster reactions. Beyond a certain point, extra heat decreases the speed at which enzymes produce chemical reactions. Enzymes work best at a normal body temperature . For most people, this is somewhere between 36.1\u00b0C to 37.2\u00b0C. When temperatures increase beyond this (especially above 40\u00b0C), enzymes start to denature . This means the bonds that bind the enzyme molecules start to break down. The enzyme either dissolves or it ceases to function properly. How Enzymes Denature pH pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a given solution. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of 1\u20136 is acidic. And a pH of 8\u201314 is basic. The pH level of your digestive system (especially your stomach or intestines) also affects enzyme activity. Enzymes generally work best within a very narrow pH range. If the environment surrounding an enzyme becomes too acidic or too basic, it will stop functioning. Each enzyme has its own ideal pH range. For example, the enzyme pepsin (which breaks down proteins) functions best at a pH of around 1.6 (very acidic). This is because it operates in the stomach, in the presence of very strong hydrochloric acid. By contrast, amylase generally functions best at a pH of around 7 (neutral). Diet Our diet also has a big impact on our digestive system. This is because many foods contain digestive enzymes which help the enzymes in our body to break the food down. For example, bananas are packed with carbohydrates. But they also contain amylase. This added amylase helps your body break down the carbs and convert it to energy quicker. That's why you'll see elite athletes like tennis players eating bananas in their breaks. They are digested quickly, providing a fast energy boost. But sometimes if we eat too much of a certain type of food - for example, too much fatty food - our enzymes can't work quickly enough to break it all down. This can cause digestive issues like indigestion or nausea.

The heat causes the liquid's molecules to vibrate faster and faster until they break free of the rest of the molecules and float away as a gas. In cooking, we usually use evaporation to reduce the amount of water in a liquid. Words like simmering and thickening usually mean using heat to cook a liquid - often a sauce - for a long time so that some of the liquid evaporates. When this happens, you are left with a thicker, richer sauce. Although it might seem like evaporating a liquid makes it disappear, this is actually an example of a reversible change . When we evaporate liquid, we can catch or trap the water vapour (for example, by putting a lid over the pot/pan). This vapour will condense as it cools until it becomes a liquid again.

The most we can do is slow time's impact through preventive measures and restoration. But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process. Threats to ancient sites Weather What are the threats Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely. How can we protect sites from these threats We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.
