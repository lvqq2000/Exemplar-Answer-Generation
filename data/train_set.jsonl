This is called rust . R\u00adust is the common name for a very common compound, iron oxide. Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker. Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust. You might have also heard of rust referred to by another name: corrosion. Corrosion is the chemical reaction that happens when metals break down over time. This happens due to factors in the environment. Therefore, rusting is an example of corrosion. Experiment Aim To investigate which substances cause iron to rust Materials 4 x small containers/jars Distilled water Marker sticky labels Calcium chloride Tablespoon and teaspoon Vegetable oil vinegar (or other acid) Iron filings Ruler Method Label your containers as follows: Jar 1 - Control (water and oxygen) Jar 2 - No water Jar 3 - No oxygen Jar 4 - Water, oxygen, vinegar Add materials to each jar based on the instructions below Place all filled jars in a quiet place and wait until you see rust in one of your jars (normally within 24 hours).

For example, glass which is used to make a glass bottle can then be changed back into a sheet of glass, that can be recycled to make a glass tabletop. Introduction to Recycling Recycling is important because: It allows us to reuse resources, some of which are limited or finite It reduces landfill so that we have less rubbish in the world It saves energy as making new products uses more energy than recycling old ones By saving energy, we are also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.

REALLY big. Our solar system is thought to have formed from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. This dust cloud collapsed and formed a solar nebula \u2014a spinning, swirling disc of material. At the centre, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually the pressure in the core was so great that our Sun was born. Matter farther out in the disc was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets and large moons. The Birth of the Solar System To model our solar system, we need to scale down the distances between the planets from the Sun and each other. Distances in space are measured by astronomical units (AU). One astronomical unit is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, which equals approximately 150 million kilometres. To put that in context, that distance is over 200,000 times longer than the distance between Melbourne and Adelaide Not all planets are equal distances apart, however. Some of the distances between planets are far larger than others.

It is shown by the formula below: Turning force (moment/torque) = Force x distance from the pivot Turning force is measured using Newton-metres (Nm) . Levers First class levers are simple machines which have the pivot between the force and the load. This allows a larger force to be applied to the load with less effort. The effort force moves over a larger distance to move the load force over a smaller distance.

It's influenced by five main factors: Latitude . The latitude of a place is its position on Earth relative to the equator. The closer a place is to the equator, the warmer it will be Altitude . The altitude of a place is its height above sea level. As altitude increases by 100m, the temperature decreases by around 1\u00b0C Ocean temperatures currents . Shallower oceans, or oceans near the equator, are generally warmer. Deeper oceans and oceans closer to the Poles are cooler. Generally, places found next to a warm ocean will have higher temperatures and wetter climates. Places found next to cool oceans have colder and drier climates Distance from oceans . Coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas. This is because oceans lose heat less quickly than land, so in winter an ocean will still retain some warmth from the summer sun Topography (or relief) . The aspect of a slope (the direction it faces) affects its temperature. If it faces the sun during the day, it will be warmer than a slope facing away from the sun The temperate of a place affects its air pressure. This in turn affects how much rainfall it gets and the direction of the prevailing wind in that area. These factors create the weather in a place.

It's influenced by five main factors: Latitude . The latitude of a place is its position on Earth relative to the equator. The closer a place is to the equator, the warmer it will be Altitude . The altitude of a place is its height above sea level. As altitude increases by 100m, the temperature decreases by around 1\u00b0C Ocean temperatures currents . Shallower oceans, or oceans near the equator, are generally warmer. Deeper oceans and oceans closer to the Poles are cooler. Generally, places found next to a warm ocean will have higher temperatures and wetter climates. Places found next to cool oceans have colder and drier climates Distance from oceans . Coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas. This is because oceans lose heat less quickly than land, so in winter an ocean will still retain some warmth from the summer sun Topography (or relief) . The aspect of a slope (the direction it faces) affects its temperature. If it faces the sun during the day, it will be warmer than a slope facing away from the sun The temperate of a place affects its air pressure. This in turn affects how much rainfall it gets and the direction of the prevailing wind in that area. These factors create the weather in a place. And long-term trends in a place's weather create its climate.

Every heartbeat pushes blood from the heart through blood vessels to all parts of the body. The heart is a complex system itself, with different components performing different functions. It has four chambers : The upper two chambers are called the atria . These receive blood entering into the heart. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, ready to be pumped to the rest of the body. And the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood back from the rest of the body The lower two chambers are called the ventricles . These are the \u2018pumps\u2019 that push blood away from the heart. The right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs. And the left ventricle receives newly-oxygenated blood from the left atrium and pumps it around the body Heart valves Blood needs to flow in a specific direction in each part of the heart. This ensures that only oxygenated blood is pumped through our bodies and that only deoxygenated blood is sent to our lungs. To ensure that blood flows in the right direction, our heart contains four heart valves . They only allow blood flowing in a certain direction to pass through them, and they close after the blood has passed through to prevent blood flowing back in the wrong direction. They're a bit like a door that can only be pushed open, not pulled open - you can only go through it from one direction. How the Heart Pumps Blood The heart has two valves between the atrium and ventricle on each side of the heart: The tricuspid valve separates the right atrium from the right ventricle The mitral/bicuspid valve separates the left atrium from the left ventricle The heart also has two valves between the ventricles and the largest arteries that carry blood away from the heart: The pulmonary/pulmonic valve is between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, which carries blood to the lungs The aortic valve is between the left ventricle and the aorta, which carries blood to the body Bioninja, Heart Structure (2019).

This visible white light is the only source of colour in our world. Colour is a result of what parts of visible white light are absorbed or reflected by an object. For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red. Colour pigments - such as paints, dyes, or inks - show colour by absorbing certain parts of the light spectrum and reflecting the parts that remain. Filters What about things like coloured windows that can change the colour of objects when light shines through them These are referred to as filters. A filter is a transparent material that absorbs some colours and allows others to pass through them. A purple colour filter will let through only purple and absorb all other colours. When a blue light is allowed through a blue filter onto a blue object, the object will still reflect blue and therefore appear blue. But when blue light from a blue filter hits a red object, the blue will be absorbed by the red object and no light will be reflected. This will give the object an appearance of being black.

Threats to ancient sites Weather What are the threats Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely. How can we protect sites from these threats We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.

This is called a reversible change . A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt. We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism. Reversible changes can also occur when the state of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate. Irreversible changes When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them. For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The \u2018cooking\u2019 of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone. Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea. This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate.

REALLY big. Our solar system is thought to have formed from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. This dust cloud collapsed and formed a solar nebula \u2014a spinning, swirling disc of material. At the centre, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually the pressure in the core was so great that our Sun was born. Matter farther out in the disc was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets and large moons. The Birth of the Solar System To model our solar system, we need to scale down the distances between the planets from the Sun and each other. Distances in space are measured by astronomical units (AU). One astronomical unit is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, which equals approximately 150 million kilometres. To put that in context, that distance is over 200,000 times longer than the distance between Melbourne and Adelaide Not all planets are equal distances apart, however. Some of the distances between planets are far larger than others.

This, of course, leads us to rockets. To get a rocket into space, you must understand how the laws of physics and other forces affect rocket flight. Without this knowledge, you cannot design a rocket to reach the speeds and heights necessary to enter orbit. How do rockets work Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion The rocket launching experiment we will do later (using a film canister as our rocket) is an example of Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion \u2013 \u201c Every action has an equal and opposite reaction \u201d. The gas rushing out of one end of the canister (the action) causes the rocket to move in the opposite direction (the reaction). Just like what happens when you let the air out of a balloon Newton's Third Law Balloons This is exactly how all rockets work - whether you use baking soda and vinegar as your fuel or a chemical rocket propellant like they do at NASA. How do the NASA rockets work These rockets use a pressurized fuel and an oxidizer. The oxidizer is something that allows the fuel to burn without using outside air. The fuel, in a gaseous state, is pressurized because this forces it out the end of the rocket just like our film canister rocket However, there are a few more parts to an actual rocket. NASA rockets use liquid hydrogen as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The fuel and oxidizer are only in these liquid states when they are in the holding tanks and they can only stay in this liquid state at extremely low temperatures. The fuel and oxidizer are allowed to combine within the combustion chamber and, as they burn, they turn into a gas (gases take up about 1,000 times more space than a liquid). This causes the intense pressure and is exactly like our film canister rocket. The carbon dioxide builds up and puts intense pressure on the canister so the lid pops off. In the case of our rocket, the fuel and oxidizer burn, are put under intense pressure, and are released through chutes at the bottom of the rocket. This propels the rocket upwards. Rocket Science: A Short Explanation Rocket fuel experiment Getting the fuel ratios right is a vital part of a successful rocket launch. You are going to try and find the most powerful combination of fuel to launch your rocket. In this experiment, we are going to use baking soda and vinegar to launch our rockets. Baking soda and vinegar react to form carbon dioxide - a gas. When this reaction occurs in a film canister, the gas builds up until it can no longer be contained and the base of the canister shoots off. Aim To investigate the most effective fuel combination to launch a rocket Materials 35 mm film canister with internal snapping lid (clear Fuji ones work the best) Timer Water vinegar Metre ruler or tape measure Baking soda Chalk Waxed paper or bowl Paper towel Measuring spoons Protective clothing and safety glasses Method Place 1 teaspoon of baking soda onto the waxed paper or bowl. Add 1/8 tsp of water to the baking soda and mix it in well. If you are using waxed paper, carefully use the wax paper to fold the damp baking soda onto itself to help mix in the water Turn the film canister lid upside-down and pack the inside of the depression with the damp baking soda. (Do not put baking soda where the canister snaps onto the lid.) Pack it tightly Turn the lid right side-up again for a moment. Does the damp baking soda stay in place If it stays, move to the next step. If the baking soda falls out, then add a little bit more water to the baking soda and mix it in, but try to add as little water as needed. The baking soda will not need to stay in the lid long Add 5 tsp of vinegar (1 tsp at a time) to the canister at a time, filling it almost to the top. You need to add as much vinegar to the canister as possible without the vinegar and the baking soda coming into contact when you later snap the lid onto the canister Go outside to an open area at least three metres from buildings. If possible, find a nearby wall and, using the chalk and metre ruler or tape measure, mark out 50 cm heights (to about two metres high) on the wall Bend down near the ground on a flat, hard spot and quickly snap the lid onto the canister to seal it. Immediately turn the canister over, so the lid is on the ground, and quickly move away. The other members of the group should start timing and recording while this happens. Wait for the chemical reaction to occur Stop timing and filming when your rockets comes back down to the ground. Record your results in your results table Tip: If the rocket did not launch, the lid might not have been sealed tightly enough. (If this happens you may simply see many bubbles coming out of the canister). The rocket may not have launched right for another reason (such as not sealing the lid fast enough). If it did not launch right, try preparing and launching the canister rocket again. You may need a little practice to get used to launching the rocket Carefully rinse out the lid and canister with water and then dry them Prepare the damp baking soda and vinegar again but this time use 3 tsp of vinegar Launch your newly prepared canister rocket as you did in Step 6. Record your results Rinse the lid and canister with water, dry them, and prepare them as before but this time use 1 tsp of vinegar Launch the canister rocket. How long does it take to launch compared to the other two launches How high does the canister go compared to the previous two times If you are unsure of any of your results, you can try repeating them (using the same amount of baking soda and vinegar) Before you start the experiment, predict which fuel combination will be the most effective/powerful.

These organs work together to make a system. These bodily systems work together to help an organism function. The primary function of the digestive system is to break down food and extract nutrients from it. This is used for energy and to help an organism grow and repair itself. Digestion occurs when food is broken down from larger and more complex substances into smaller, simple molecules. The foods we eat contain proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Our digestive system breaks these down and then absorbs and uses the smaller molecules within them for different processes in our body. How the Digestive System Works Most humans eat between 1.2-2.2 kilograms of food each day. That's over half a ton of food each year But because of our digestive system, this food doesn't just sit in our stomachs like a lead weight. It gets digested through five key steps: Ingestion (when we take food into our bodies) Mechanical digestion (when we chew food to break it into smaller pieces to enable us to swallow it) Chemical digestion (special chemicals called enzymes break down food into smaller molecules) Absorption of nutrients Egestion (when we excrete unusable or undigested materials) How does our digestive system work Each part of the digestive system helps break down and move food through the gastrointestinal tract (or digestive tract) which leads from the mouth to the anus. The mouth Our mouth is responsible for physically and chemically breaking down food. Physically, our teeth, jaw, and tongue break down food into smaller pieces through biting, grinding, and chewing. This is called mechanical digestion . Salivary glands make saliva to help make the food slippery. Saliva ensures food can be easily moved around our mouth and swallowed. Saliva also contains amylase which is an enzyme that chemically breaks down carbohydrates (like bread) into simple sugars (like glucose). By breaking down our food into smaller pieces through mechanical digestion, the enzymes in chemical digestion can act on this food more easily. The oesophagus The oesophagus is a muscular tube that transports food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. When we swallow food, these muscles squeeze the food down through a process called peristalsis . This massaging of food down your oesophagus is so powerful that you can even swallow if you are hanging upside down. At the end of the oesophagus is a weak sphincter (ring of muscle) that allows food to enter the stomach. This sphincter normally stays closed to stop what is in your stomach from flowing back up your oesophagus. The stomach The stomach is a bag of muscle that is lined with mucus. Like the mouth, the stomach has both mechanical and chemical digestion occurring within it. The stomach\u2019s muscles physically churn the stomach contents while pepsin (an enzyme) and hydrochloric acid chemically break down any proteins. This hydrochloric acid is very acidic and is usually at a pH of between 1.5 - 3.5. The stomach lining is covered in mucus so that the pepsin and hydrochloric acid won\u2019t begin to digest the stomach muscle itself Different foods take different amounts of time to transit through the stomach. \u2018Heavier\u2019, protein-based foods (like meat and seafood) generally take longer than foods with a high liquid content (like fruit). What Does the Stomach Do The small intestines Food leaves the stomach as a runny, smelly liquid called chyme . It enters the small intestine, which is actually quite long (about five metres) but very narrow. The small intestine makes a digestive \u2018juice\u2019 using enzymes produced in the pancreas and an acidic bile produced in the liver. This \u2018juice\u2019 completes the break down of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The small intestine is lined with structures called villi which increase the surface area through which nutrients can be absorbed. Small Intestine Food Absorption The large intestines The large intestines are shorter than the small intestines (around 1.5 metres) but are wider. This is where the final part of digestion occurs. Water and some vitamins are absorbed into the body. Bacteria help break down any remaining nutrients. Any remaining fibre and undigested food is stored in the lower part of the large intestine (called the rectum ) until it is expelled from the body through the anus as faeces. Modelling the digestive system Aim To use everyday items to model the structure and function of parts of the digestive system Materials Potato masher (or other implement to crush food) Medium Ziploc bag Bowl plate/tray A pair of stockings/tights Funnel 30 mL water 1 x 400 mL beaker 30 mL lemon juice or vinegar 1 x 50 mL measuring cylinder Plain biscuit Scissors Small banana or piece of bread Method Place the biscuit and banana in a bowl and gently crush both using the potato masher Pour the crushed food into an empty ziploc bag Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of water and pour it into the ziploc bag. The water represents saliva Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of the lemon juice or vinegar Pour the lemon juice or vinegar into the bag. This fluid represents the stomach acid. Make sure there is no air in the bag and seal it Squeeze the bag for about a minute, further crushing up the biscuits and banana. This represents the mechanical digestion inside the stomach Once the stomach contents feel like a thick liquid, cut a small hole in the one corner and carefully squeeze it into the open leg of the tights (small intestine) Hold the tights over the tray or a bowl and gently squeeze the liquid out. The liquid on the tray represents the nutrients the body absorbs and uses Keep squeezing until no more liquid comes out. The food left behind in the tights represents waste products that cannot be absorbed Cut a hole in the bottom of the tights and squeeze the contents into the jar.

This helps us make sense of a contemporary account whilst also using a later analysis to fill in gaps in our understanding. In this task, we will look at the democratic process of ostracising a citizen from Athens. Ostracism was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared. Let\u2019s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness). Source 1 (secondary source) \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void. Then they separated the names, and the man who had received the most votes they proclaimed banished for ten years, with the right to enjoy the income from his property.\" Plutarch, Plutarch's Lives, trans.

They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant.

Density of Matter Flotation can occur naturally (like when you drop an apple into water). But it can also occur when air or gas bubbles are created in the mixture. The bubbles will rise to the top, and the lower-density particles will attach themselves to the gas bubbles and rise with them. This separates matter suspended in a liquid by bringing it to the surface. Flotation works best with small particles (which are small enough to attach to an air bubble).

This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp. Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide. The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.

Retrieved from https://www.suez.com.au/en-au/sustainability-tips/learn-about-waste-streams/general-waste-streams/paper-and-cardboard-recycling However, we can't recycle paper forever. That's because the fibres which paper is made of get shorter and shorter each time it is recycled. After paper has been recycled about 6-8 times, the fibres in that recycled paper are so short that they can't thread together with other paper fibres to create a new sheet of paper. If you tried to make paper using these fibres, the paper would have holes in it or would tear very easily. Create your own recycled paper Factories that create recycled paper have very complex (and very expensive) machinery to create recycled paper that looks as good as new.

If the mixture is too watery, tear up some more toilet paper and add it to your mixture Place the mesh at the bottom of the cake pan/container. Ensure that the mesh goes right to the edges of the pan and that the edges come up the sides (so you can pick it up by the edges in Step 7) Pour the mixture into the cake pan Grab the edges of the wire mesh and pull it up straight after pouring the mixture in. The water will drain through the mesh into the cake pan and the paper mulch should now be sitting on top of the mesh Once the water stops dripping, place the mesh screen on the newspaper Knead the paper flat until it is solid and dry Roll the paper with a rolling pin Leave the paper to dry Summarise and explain how we can create new paper from recycled paper.

This bending of light is called refraction . How Refraction Occurs You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water. Why does refraction occur When light moves from the less dense air to a \u2018heavier\u2019 - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly. Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air.

In this task, we will look at the democratic process of ostracising a citizen from Athens. Ostracism was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared. Let\u2019s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness). Source 1 (secondary source) \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void.

These plates are huge slabs of rock that lie under the ocean floor. There are many different tectonic plates and each of them are a different size. Look at the image below - it shows you a picture with all the different tectonic plates and where they are located. Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth\u2019s surface and we cannot see them. Continental drift These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of magma (molten rock) push the plates in different directions. This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called continental drift . We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant supercontinent called Pangaea . But continental drift caused the tectonic plates to move away from each other. This broke up the continents into the separate landmasses we know today. How Pangaea Broke Apart We can see the evidence of continental drift today. The Himalayas - the tallest mountain range in the world - was formed when the Indian tectonic plate moved north over millions of years and rammed into the Eurasian plate. When the two plates hit each other, one was forced upwards. This created the mountain range.

If the people who live in a community have a say in what that community should look like and how it should be run, liveability will improve. And by engaging with their community, people also engage with each other. Community engagement never used to be a problem prior to the growth of larger cities. Indigenous communities - like Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples - developed a strong system to build community prior to European settlement. This community connection was a kinship system that gave people a place in the family and clan, and a sense of order. They would have clear roles and responsibilities in the community based on their totem and birth order. Aboriginal Kinship: Nations, Clans, and Family Groups However, community engagement is becoming rarer in our modern world. As many as 75% people don't know their neighbours' names, despite living so close to them for years or decades. This figure is significantly higher than it was in the mid-20th Century. And fewer people are engaging with their community through volunteer work, being a member of a club or association, or being involved in other community events. That's part of the reason why some places have what is being described as a \u2018loneliness epidemic.\u2019 How the UK is Fighting the Loneliness Epidemic How do you build connected communities There's no one way to create happy, connected communities. Any idea which brings people together and makes a city or town feel like it is made by the people within it, rather than the buildings and streets, can achieve this. The Happy City movement emphasises designing cities which maximise the possibility for interactions between its residents. This includes things like more community volunteering and community-run events (like walking tours and workshops) more public-friendly architecture (like markets and squares) and a greater celebration of a city or town's unique heritage or culture. The Common Factor of Happy Cities City planners now also think about the emotional infrastructure of a place. This means they think of including spaces which allow people to emotionally connect with each other and feel a sense of belonging to and connection with their city. A good example of this are the town squares in cities across Europe. For centuries, they've been the heartbeat and central meeting point of communities across the continent. Siena's Piazza del Campo Read the quote below. Use it to explain how piazzas (town squares) enhance the liveability of towns and cities in Italy For Italians, the piazza or square, is not just the architectural space that characterizes cities and villages, but an open air, urban living room. It is the heart of each Italian town where history, architecture and social relations become one. The piazza means belonging to a society and it means daily life. In each town, it reunites the two most important buildings, the city hall and the church: the political and the religious power face each other, with people\u2019s daily life, new acquaintances and commercial deals all taking place between them. The piazza is a space which is not only constituted by architectural arrangements but, more than any other, comes to life thanks to the people who fill it with meaning \u2026 The piazza has a meaning that goes well beyond that found in a dictionary: it means even the most lonely people can find someone to talk with. It means that, without spending a single cent in a restaurant or a movie theatre, they can enjoy hours of social life, feel a sense of belonging, learn about births, deaths, marriages and finally go home without that terrible feeling of estrangement and loneliness typical of when we feel alone.

What is a Planet A planet needs to have three key features: It must orbit a star (in our solar system, this is the Sun). It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. A rectangular asteroid is therefore not a planet It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun. A cluster of objects close together are therefore unlikely to be planets How big are our planets Our solar system features eight planets. Although there is some debate within the scientific community as to whether Pluto should be classified as a planet or a \u2018dwarf planet\u2019, it is now widely accepted that it is not a planet. Some planets in our solar system are really big while others are quite small.

REALLY big. Our solar system is thought to have formed from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. This dust cloud collapsed and formed a solar nebula \u2014a spinning, swirling disc of material. At the centre, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually the pressure in the core was so great that our Sun was born. Matter farther out in the disc was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets and large moons. The Birth of the Solar System To model our solar system, we need to scale down the distances between the planets from the Sun and each other. Distances in space are measured by astronomical units (AU). One astronomical unit is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, which equals approximately 150 million kilometres. To put that in context, that distance is over 200,000 times longer than the distance between Melbourne and Adelaide Not all planets are equal distances apart, however. Some of the distances between planets are far larger than others.

For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas. These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places. Why are cities generally more liveable Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities. For example, Tokyo (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them. Tokyo - City Guide Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium density housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase congestion (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel \u2018walled in\u2019. Singapore - Balancing Density Space Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases. Liveability in the Suburbs However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is. Why are rural areas generally less liveable In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities. This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities. For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them. In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal wealth distribution . This means that a country's wealth is controlled by the wealthiest and most powerful citizens, who usually live in cities. Either because of neglect or corruption in these countries, regional areas receive limited funding and can't afford the services and facilities that its citizens need.

Reflection is not just the reason we can see ourselves in a mirror - but it is the only reason we can see anything at all Light, either from the sun or something like an electric lightbulb in this room, reflects off objects into our eyes. This is why we can see the things that we do. Ever wondered why you can't see anything in the dark You can't see the objects around you, but they don't stop existing. Instead, the light source that has been reflecting off the object has gone, meaning we can no longer see the object. Different types of reflection When we think of reflection, we often think of mirrors. Because they have very smooth and polished surfaces, these types of surfaces produce what is called specular reflection, where the light reflects at the same angle as it hits the surface. This is why you can get a perfect reflection in a bathroom mirror, or how can you can see the sky and mountains reflected on the surface of a still lake on a clear day. However, most objects are not so smooth and polished, which is why you can't see your face reflected back at you when you stare at a pile of loose pebbles. Light shining on rougher objects produces diffuse reflection, where the light scatters (or diffuses) off the surface in different directions. Specular Diffusion Reflection If we needed to add light to a dark outside space, we would need to use a smooth reflective surface. We would also need to find and reflect the focal point of a source of light as that would give us the most amount of light in the dark space.

The force applied to turn the objects around the pivot or the turning force is called the moment , or torque . Turning Forces The torque or the turning force is calculated by multiplying the applied force (in N) by the distance (in metres) of the applied force from the pivot. It is shown by the formula below: Turning force (moment/torque) = Force x distance from the pivot Turning force is measured using Newton-metres (Nm) . Levers First class levers are simple machines which have the pivot between the force and the load. This allows a larger force to be applied to the load with less effort. The effort force moves over a larger distance to move the load force over a smaller distance. As the ratio of effort (force) arm length to load arm length increases, the mechanical advantage of a first class lever increases. How Levers Work Seesaws used in playgrounds are an example of first class levers. The turning forces can be balanced around a seesaw pivot by adjusting the distance each person sits from the pivot.

We can also explore matter's compressibility , which measures how much a volume of matter changes when placed under pressure. Generally, solids and liquids can't be compressed much as their atoms are already closely packed together. There isn't space for them to get any closer together when the matter is compressed, so the volume doesn't change. But there are big gaps between atoms in a gas, so it can be compressed more easily.

This is called a reversible change . A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt. We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism. Reversible changes can also occur when the state of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate. Irreversible changes When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them. For example, you can't \u2018uncook\u2019 an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't \u2018untoast\u2019 a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The \u2018cooking\u2019 of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone. Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea. This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate.

Light rays travel from a source, like the sun, in straight lines. If a solid (opaque) object gets in the way, it stops light rays from travelling through it. This results in an area of darkness appearing behind the object. The dark area is called a shadow. Sunlight that travels towards the Earth takes just over 8 minutes to reach us. It travels at nearly 300,000 kilometres per second When the rays reach Earth, they hit whatever is in their path. If the object they hit is opaque, the light cannot pass through, and a shadow forms. This is why the Norwegian town of Rjukan is in darkness for six months of the year - the light rays from the sun hit the mountain before they reach the town. It is easy to see shadows on bright, sunny days outside - objects such as trees, buildings and people form shadows in these conditions. But shadows also appear indoors due to artificial light. Sundials Humans first began using shadows to help tell the time of day thousands of years ago. They do this using sundials . The oldest known sundial was made by the Ancient Egyptians and dates back to 1500 BCE. A sundial used the shadows cast by the sun to tell the time of day. A dial would be placed in the centre of a circle with markings around the edge, indicating times of the day. As the Sun changes relative positions in the sky over the day, the position of the shadow cast by the dial changes to align with the different times around the outside of the circular plate. This way you can tell the time by looking at where the shadow is cast, using the markings around the edge of the circle. How Sundials Use the Sun and Shadows to Tell the Time The shadows cast by the sun change throughout the day and throughout the year as the sun's position in the sky also changes. This is why the town of Rjukan is only in darkness for six months, not for the whole year. In spring anmd summer, the position of the Sun has changed - so the Sun's rays hit the town instead of being blocked by the mountain. Experiment Aim To investigate shadows by making a human sundial Materials Open space with concrete or another hard surface A clock Chalk Tape measure Method You need a clear, sunny day for this experiment. Check the weather forecast first Go to your open area where you can mark your sundial. You will need to visit it at least four times during the day so it needs to be nearby Draw a small circle (or make an X) on the ground to mark where your partner will stand each time you measure their shadow. It\u2019s important to stand in the same place each time to get accurate measurements Early in the day (possibly 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM), have your partner stand on the marked spot. Your partner can also raise their arms up and clasped them above their head so they are like the hour hand on a clock Trace your partner\u2019s shadow using sidewalk chalk write the time next to it Measure the length of your partner\u2019s shadow and record it in your results table Measure the distance from the last shadow Record the direction that the shadow has moved from the last shadow by noting the path of the sun. (HINT: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west) Come back at regular intervals throughout the day trace your shadow again, noting the time next to each tracing. You may want to check every hour but you could also do every 2-3 hours if you want. For example, if you make your first measurement at 9:00 AM, your next three could be at 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM In general, how many centimetres does the shadow move between tracings What direction does the shadow move across the day What is the relationship between the sun and your shadow How did your shadow change throughout the day Create a line graph based on the change in the length of your shadows.

It is made up of a rainbow of different colours and will be absorbed , reflected , refracted , or transmitted if it hits another object. When white visible light, such as sunlight or light from a torch, travels from air through water then back into air again, it is refracted . This means that the light bends as it passes at an angle from one transparent thing (air, glass or water) into another. When this happens, our view of an object is distorted. Visible light and rainbows How much a light is refracted depends on the wavelength of the light. The shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. Lights of different colours have different wavelengths, so each colour is refracted by different amounts. Therefore, white visible light is split up after passing from air to water and the individual colours become visible. This scattering of light allows us to see the spectrum of colours that form a rainbow. How Rainbows Form We will be looking more at how refraction works more later on.

So, how do we decide where to direct time, money, and effort when choosing which sites to protect UNESCO world heritage sites One of the duties of UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) is to identify and protect ancient sites. These are designated as World Heritage sites . World Heritage sites are places that have outstanding universal value to humanity and, therefore, need to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy. What are UNESCO World Heritage Sites Check out the interactive map below that shows all the World Heritage sites. How many have you been to Map of World Heritage Sites What makes a world heritage site UNESCO uses 10 different criteria to identify which sites are deserving of protection as World Heritage sites. They are summarised in the image below, but the full explanation of each criteria can be found at the link below. World Heritage Sites - Selection Criteria The first six criteria usually apply to historical sites (like the Acropolis in Athens), and the last four criteria usually apply to natural sites (like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia). Of course, an ancient site doesn't need to be recognised as a World Heritage site to be worthy of protection. There are many ancient sites across the world that haven't been designated a World Heritage site but which are still carefully preserved. But the criteria used for awarding World Heritage status is still a useful guide for us when we decide whether an ancient or historical site should be protected. How do you think the heritage site fits your criteria Do you think your chosen criteria point is the most important Why or why not Does your chosen criteria connect to the reasons to preserve ancient sites that you have explored previously Why or why not; question: Do you think your chosen criteria point is the most important?

Light rays travel from a source, like the sun, in straight lines. If a solid (opaque) object gets in the way, it stops light rays from travelling through it. This results in an area of darkness appearing behind the object. The dark area is called a shadow. Sunlight that travels towards the Earth takes just over 8 minutes to reach us. It travels at nearly 300,000 kilometres per second When the rays reach Earth, they hit whatever is in their path. If the object they hit is opaque, the light cannot pass through, and a shadow forms. This is why the Norwegian town of Rjukan is in darkness for six months of the year - the light rays from the sun hit the mountain before they reach the town. It is easy to see shadows on bright, sunny days outside - objects such as trees, buildings and people form shadows in these conditions. But shadows also appear indoors due to artificial light. Sundials Humans first began using shadows to help tell the time of day thousands of years ago. They do this using sundials . The oldest known sundial was made by the Ancient Egyptians and dates back to 1500 BCE. A sundial used the shadows cast by the sun to tell the time of day. A dial would be placed in the centre of a circle with markings around the edge, indicating times of the day. As the Sun changes relative positions in the sky over the day, the position of the shadow cast by the dial changes to align with the different times around the outside of the circular plate. This way you can tell the time by looking at where the shadow is cast, using the markings around the edge of the circle. How Sundials Use the Sun and Shadows to Tell the Time The shadows cast by the sun change throughout the day and throughout the year as the sun's position in the sky also changes. This is why the town of Rjukan is only in darkness for six months, not for the whole year. In spring anmd summer, the position of the Sun has changed - so the Sun's rays hit the town instead of being blocked by the mountain. Experiment Aim To investigate shadows by making a human sundial Materials Open space with concrete or another hard surface A clock Chalk Tape measure Method You need a clear, sunny day for this experiment. Check the weather forecast first Go to your open area where you can mark your sundial. You will need to visit it at least four times during the day so it needs to be nearby Draw a small circle (or make an X) on the ground to mark where your partner will stand each time you measure their shadow. It\u2019s important to stand in the same place each time to get accurate measurements Early in the day (possibly 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM), have your partner stand on the marked spot. Your partner can also raise their arms up and clasped them above their head so they are like the hour hand on a clock Trace your partner\u2019s shadow using sidewalk chalk write the time next to it Measure the length of your partner\u2019s shadow and record it in your results table Measure the distance from the last shadow Record the direction that the shadow has moved from the last shadow by noting the path of the sun. (HINT: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west) Come back at regular intervals throughout the day trace your shadow again, noting the time next to each tracing. You may want to check every hour but you could also do every 2-3 hours if you want. For example, if you make your first measurement at 9:00 AM, your next three could be at 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM In general, how many centimetres does the shadow move between tracings What direction does the shadow move across the day What is the relationship between the sun and your shadow How did your shadow change throughout the day Create a line graph based on the change in the length of your shadows.

You know that enzymes play a key role in breaking down food and delivering energy and nutrients to our body quicker. And, when our bodies aren't working properly, digestive enzyme tablets can supplement our naturally-occuring enzymes to assist our digestive system. But do digestive enzyme tablets actually work For a digestive enzyme tablet to \u2018work\u2019, scientists must prove that it speeds up the chemical digestion of various foods under a range of conditions. To test this, scientists must test a tablet under the same conditions as those found in the human digestive system. As all enzymes must spend some time in the stomach, this means they must survive high levels of acidity. Some pharmaceutical companies try to solve this problem by coating their tablets with a protective shell which prevents it from dissolving until it reaches the stomach or the small intestine. This is called enteric coating . Scientists would also need to test how enzymes function under different temperature conditions. They need to replicate the different temperatures a digestive enzyme tablet might endure in the human body and when it is transported and stored prior to consumption. Test a digestive enzyme tablet You and your team must work as scientists to test a digestive enzyme tablet. You're checking its effectiveness to verify that it actually works, and that it isn't just a clever piece of marketing. Here's what you'll need to do: Choose a digestive enzyme tablet or supplement to test. Isolate the enzyme contained in the tablet Decide how to test how your tablet's function is affected by either or both of pH and temperature Develop and run a scientific experiment to test the effectiveness of your digestive enzyme tablet You'll need to design an experiment in which you can simulate the conditions the tablet would encounter in the stomach. Because temperature and pH level both influence enzyme function, you'll need to make sure the tablet can withstand the conditions it will encounter as it travels through the gastrointestinal tract. The tablet needs to function (to enhance digestion) in the same temperature and pH conditions as will occur in the body. You'll need to test whether, in these conditions, the tablet helps break down food to its smaller \u2018building block\u2019 molecules.

Other than shape, these words all have a technical meaning: Weight is how heavy something is. Or, technically, how much downwards force that gravity exerts on the object Mass is the amount of matter in an object Volume is the amount of space taken up by an object Matter can have other properties, like a boiling point or melting point. We can also explore matter's compressibility , which measures how much a volume of matter changes when placed under pressure. Generally, solids and liquids can't be compressed much as their atoms are already closely packed together. There isn't space for them to get any closer together when the matter is compressed, so the volume doesn't change. But there are big gaps between atoms in a gas, so it can be compressed more easily.

It is made up of a rainbow of different colours and will be absorbed , reflected , refracted , or transmitted if it hits another object. When white visible light, such as sunlight or light from a torch, travels from air through water then back into air again, it is refracted . This means that the light bends as it passes at an angle from one transparent thing (air, glass or water) into another. When this happens, our view of an object is distorted. Visible light and rainbows How much a light is refracted depends on the wavelength of the light. The shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. Lights of different colours have different wavelengths, so each colour is refracted by different amounts. Therefore, white visible light is split up after passing from air to water and the individual colours become visible. This scattering of light allows us to see the spectrum of colours that form a rainbow. How Rainbows Form We will be looking more at how refraction works more later on. Experiment Aim To split white visible light into its colours Materials Glass Water Sunlight or a small torch (not an LED light) 1 x A3/A4 paper Access to a darkened space Method Fill the glass almost to the top with water If you are using a torch, place the glass of water on the white piece of paper, and move the torch around until you see a rainbow on the piece of paper If you are using sunlight, place the glass so that the sun shines directly through the water, onto a sheet of white paper underneath it or on the floor if it is on a table Adjust the paper and the glass until a rainbow forms on the paper Try holding the glass of water at different heights and angles to see if it has a different effect Draw how you made your rainbow appear.

They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised). This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp. Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide. The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.

But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee. Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce. Types of bees There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a honey bee. These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs. It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees. We're Saving the Wrong Bees Which flowers do bees pollinate Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours. They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar. It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate. 70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.

This means that they can change state - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough. For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid - when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases. Changes of state in matter occurs when heat energy is transferred to or from the matter. The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy). When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid. Changes of State in Matter There are four main changes in state: Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas. This might also be called vapourisation if this change in state occurs above the liquid's boiling point Condensation : when a gas or vapour turns into a liquid There are two less common changes in state which we won't explore: Sublimation : when a solid turns straight into a gas, without turning into a liquid first Deposition : when a gas turns straight into a solid, without turning into a liquid first Experiment Aim To demonstrate under what conditions water changes its state of matter Materials Water Metal tray Ice cubes Oven glove Electric kettle Method Pass around ice cubes amongst students.

This helps us make sense of a contemporary account whilst also using a later analysis to fill in gaps in our understanding. In this task, we will look at the democratic process of ostracising a citizen from Athens. Ostracism was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared. Let\u2019s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness). Source 1 (secondary source) \u201cThe method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void. Then they separated the names, and the man who had received the most votes they proclaimed banished for ten years, with the right to enjoy the income from his property.\" Plutarch, Plutarch's Lives, trans.

Evaporation is a natural part of the water cycle and it occurs even when temperatures are below boiling. Whenever the sun hits water, the sun warms the surface of the water. This is enough for the atoms in the surface of the water to move fast enough to break free of their bonds, and some water escapes as a gas. This is a problem. In hot dry areas with lots of sunlight, fresh water from rivers, dams, and reservoirs is evaporated quickly. Even though the water vapour only spends around nine days in the atmosphere, when it falls to Earth as rain it might not find its way into a drinking water catchment. So the more water we lose to evaporation, the less we have available for drinking Experiment We know that water will evaporate when it is heated. We can't stop the Sun from shining - so is there anything else we can do to slow the process of evaporation One factor we can control is the surface area of water. Surface area is the amount of a surface's area that is exposed to the environment. In this experiment, we will compare the evaporation of water from a container with a small surface area (a glass) with a container that has a large surface area (a bowl). Aim To identify how surface area affects how fast water evaporates Materials 1 x bowl Water 1 x glass Measuring cup Method Using the measuring cup, measure out 50 mL of water and pour into the glass Measure out another 50 mL of water and pour it into the bowl Place the containers next to each other and leave them for few hours, preferably somewhere like a sunny windowsill Pour the water from the glass into the measuring cup and record the amount in your results table.

They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised). This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp. Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide. The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.

You also know that the plant seed contains an embryo which, once it germinates, will grow to become a new plant. This represents the completion of a plant's reproductive cycle. It would be problematic for a \u2018parent\u2019 plant if all its seeds germinated right next to it. The new plants would compete with the parent plant for light, soil nutrients, and water - so it is likely that either the parent plant or some of the new seedlings would die. Plants can't move, so they have had to evolve strategies to disperse - or scatter - their seeds further away from them. This increases the likelihood that the plant successfully passes its genes on to the next generation. There are five main strategies which angiosperms use to disperse their seeds. Wind dispersal With wind dispersal, seeds are blown from the plant and germinate where they land (if they land in healthy soil). To help their chances that at least some of the seeds land in a place suitable for growth, these plants have to produce lots of seeds. Seeds that are dispersed using the wind are light and can be carried long distances. Many have evolved shapes that help them stay airborne for longer. Some plants, like kauri and maple trees, have \u2018winged\u2019 seeds. They don\u2019t float away but flutter to the ground. This softens their impact and reduces the chances of the seed being damaged. How a Vortex Helps Dandelions Fly Maple Seeds Falling Water dispersal Many plants have seeds that use water as a means of dispersal. The seeds float away from the parent plant. These plants have evolved seeds that have hard but light shells that allow them to float down streams and rivers. For example, mangrove trees live in estuaries. If a mangrove seed falls during low tide, it can begin to root in the soil. If the seeds fall in the water, they are carried away by the tide to grow somewhere else. Animal dispersal Animals can disperse seeds both internally and externally. Internally , animals are attracted to fruit and eat them for food. They also ingest the seeds. Most seeds will survive their journey through the digestive system due to their protective seed coat. They are then deposited in manure far away from the parent plant. Fruit Animal Dispersal Externally , animals can brush up against plants as they move through the undergrowth. Many plants have taken advantage of this by growing seeds as sticky or prickly burrs which stick to an animal's fur or feathers. They stick to the animal as it moves away from the plant and, when they eventually fall off, they are a long way from their parent plant. Explosion Some parent plants produce seeds in pods. When dry, these pods explode to spread their seeds as far away as possible. Seed Dispersal by Explosion Fire In countries that experience regular bushfires (like Australia), some plants have adapted their seed dispersal to fire. Plants like banksias and eucalypts need the high temperatures of fires to trigger the release of their seeds. Their seeds are often in cones or fruits that are completely sealed with resin. These cones/fruits can only open to release their seeds after the heat of a fire has physically melted the resin. The intensity and timing of the fire is important. It needs to be hot enough to trigger the seeds to be released, but if fires are too frequent, there is not enough time for the plants to grow big enough to make new seeds. Why the Giant Sequoia Needs Fire to Grow Describe the characteristics of seeds that are dispersed by water, by animal fur/feathers, and by wind Explain why seeds need to be dispersed far away from their parent plant Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat Is there a correlation between maximum time aloft and the distance each seed travelled Explain your answer using examples from your experimental results; question: Describe the characteristics of seeds that are dispersed by water, by animal fur/feathers, and by wind; rubric: {\"items\": [\"I can describe the characteristics of three of these types of seeds\", \"I can describe the characteristics of two of these types of seeds\", \"I can describe the characteristics of one of these types of seeds\", \"No evidence\"], \"criteria\": \"Sexual reproduction in angiosperms\", \"total_score\": \"3\", \"curriculum_codes\": {\"au\": [\"AC9S8U02\", \"VCSSU094\", \"SC4-14W\"]}}\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"\"Seeds dispersed by water float and tend to have a hard outer covering to keep the inside of the seed dry.

But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee. Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce. Types of bees There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a honey bee. These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs. It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees. We're Saving the Wrong Bees Which flowers do bees pollinate Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours. They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have \u2018ultraviolet nectar guides\u2019 on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar. It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate. 70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.

A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a specific chemical reaction. In digestion, most enzymes are used to chemically breakdown a specific large substance into its smaller chemical \u2018building block\u2019 components. All digestive enzymes are hydrolases , which means they use water to break chemical bonds joining larger molecules together. When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall. Digestive Enzymes Each digestive enzyme is specialised to produce one type of chemical reaction which breaks down one specific substance. So our digestive system has many different types of enzymes. Some of the main ones are below. Enzyme Location Substance digested Product formed Amylase Mouth small intestine Carbohydrates (starch) Starch to maltose Maltase Small intestine Carbohydrates (maltose) Maltose to glucose Lactase Small intestine Carbohydrates (lactose) Lactose to glucose Pepsin Stomach Protein Peptides Trypsin Small intestine Protein Peptides Peptidases/Proteases Small intestine Peptide Amino acids Lipase Small intestine Fats and oils Fatty acids \u2018Artificial\u2019 enzymes Many health issues can affect enzyme function.

The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called refraction . How Refraction Occurs You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water. Why does refraction occur When light moves from the less dense air to a \u2018heavier\u2019 - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly. Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air. When using our glass of water example, this means that the light bends once when it travels through the glass cup into the water, and then it bends again when it travels out of the glass cup and into the air. Experiment Aim To observe how the refraction of light affects an image Materials 1 x A4 paper Glass Texta/marker Water Method On the piece of paper, use the marker to draw two arrows on it.

So why do we bother protecting them Do ancient sites have any value for us They connect us to the past Preserving ancient sites and objects is important when they reflect our cultural, social, economic, political, archaeological, or architectural history. This history is important because it connects us to specific times, places, and events that were significant milestones in our collective past. Visiting these sites provides us with a sense of place, and maintains continuity between our past and our present. It helps us understand how we arrived at where and who we are today. Social cultural benefits A community benefits when its citizens take pride in its history and share a common desire to preserve and share their unique past. The tangible presence that ancient sites provide enriches the cultural heritage of a place and its people. They help people connect with each other and with the place that they live. It makes them feel part of something that has existed for hundreds or thousands of years. It expands human knowledge By studying history, we learn more about who we are and where we've come from. This grows our knowledge about our species and civilisations, which we can use to make better decisions into the future. Knowing how ancient people and societies dealt with issues in the past helps us to recognise those same issues in the present or the future. And if we know how people tried to respond to these problems in the past and what worked (and didn't work), we can use our learnings to make better decisions today. Economic benefits Maintaining and saving ancient sites creates a major demand for tourism. Visiting ancient sites provides people from all over the world with an opportunity to enjoy something spectacular and learn about other cultures and their histories. For this reason, preserving ancient sites can make a big difference to a country's economy. For example, close to 15 million people visit the Pyramids of Giza (in Egypt) every year Many of these visitors would not visit Egypt if the Pyramids had not been protected and preserved. Visitors who are there to see ancient sites spend money on accommodation, food and drink, and on other local wares. This creates employment for thousands of people. The act of preserving an ancient site and making it available to the public also creates many jobs for local communities (workers, cleaners, tour guides, security guards, etc).

Flowering plants are called angiosperms (which means \u2018hidden seeds\u2019 in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds. In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task. Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the carpel . Stamen There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes: The anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced The filament , which is a small stalk that supports/holds the anther Carpel There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a pistil . The carpel includes: The stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination and means the plant has been fertilised The style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary The ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form The ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred Though the petal and the sepal are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role. The petals of a flower are what attracts pollinators to the flower.

They generally start at a high place (like a mountain range) and flow downhill. This is because gravity pulls things - including water - towards the centre of the Earth.

They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of magma (molten rock) push the plates in different directions. This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called continental drift . We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant supercontinent called Pangaea . But continental drift caused the tectonic plates to move away from each other. This broke up the continents into the separate landmasses we know today. How Pangaea Broke Apart We can see the evidence of continental drift today. The Himalayas - the tallest mountain range in the world - was formed when the Indian tectonic plate moved north over millions of years and rammed into the Eurasian plate. When the two plates hit each other, one was forced upwards. This created the mountain range. Experiment Aim To simulate the movement of tectonic plates Materials Paper plates Plain cookies or Marie biscuits Method Place both cookies next to each other on the plate and let their edges touch Start to gently rattle and shake the paper plate and watch how the cookies drift apart when what is underneath them shifts If North and South America are drifting towards Asia, which ocean would become smaller Which ocean would become bigger What do the cookies and the paper plate represent Which continent is Africa drifting towards Which direction is it drifting; question: If North and South America are drifting towards Asia, which ocean would become smaller?

Reflection is not just the reason we can see ourselves in a mirror - but it is the only reason we can see anything at all Light, either from the sun or something like an electric lightbulb in this room, reflects off objects into our eyes. This is why we can see the things that we do. Ever wondered why you can't see anything in the dark You can't see the objects around you, but they don't stop existing. Instead, the light source that has been reflecting off the object has gone, meaning we can no longer see the object. Different types of reflection When we think of reflection, we often think of mirrors. Because they have very smooth and polished surfaces, these types of surfaces produce what is called specular reflection, where the light reflects at the same angle as it hits the surface. This is why you can get a perfect reflection in a bathroom mirror, or how can you can see the sky and mountains reflected on the surface of a still lake on a clear day. However, most objects are not so smooth and polished, which is why you can't see your face reflected back at you when you stare at a pile of loose pebbles. Light shining on rougher objects produces diffuse reflection, where the light scatters (or diffuses) off the surface in different directions. Specular Diffusion Reflection If we needed to add light to a dark outside space, we would need to use a smooth reflective surface. We would also need to find and reflect the focal point of a source of light as that would give us the most amount of light in the dark space.

Threats to ancient sites Weather What are the threats Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely. How can we protect sites from these threats We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.

They are made up of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. These mixtures are examples of reversible changes in that they can be separated back into their original substances. For example, if we mix salt into water, we will make a mixture. However, this mixture can be separated back into salt and water. This can be done by evaporating the water, which leaves behind the salt. Mixtures solubility If a substance can dissolve in water, we can say it is soluble . If a substance cannot dissolve in water, it is insoluble . Some insoluble substances will sink to the bottom and some will float to the top. Some will do both while others are suspended in the water. For example, when you swim in the ocean you can't see chunks of salt in the water, even though you know that the sea is salty. This is because the salt has dissolved in the water - it is soluble. But if you were eating some corn and some corn kernels fell into the water, they wouldn't be dissolved. You would be able to see them float for hours.

This visible white light is the only source of colour in our world. Colour is a result of what parts of visible white light are absorbed or reflected by an object. For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red. Colour pigments - such as paints, dyes, or inks - show colour by absorbing certain parts of the light spectrum and reflecting the parts that remain. Filters What about things like coloured windows that can change the colour of objects when light shines through them These are referred to as filters. A filter is a transparent material that absorbs some colours and allows others to pass through them. A purple colour filter will let through only purple and absorb all other colours. When a blue light is allowed through a blue filter onto a blue object, the object will still reflect blue and therefore appear blue. But when blue light from a blue filter hits a red object, the blue will be absorbed by the red object and no light will be reflected. This will give the object an appearance of being black.

Flowering plants are called angiosperms (which means \u2018hidden seeds\u2019 in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds. In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task. Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the carpel . Stamen There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes: The anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced The filament , which is a small stalk that supports/holds the anther Carpel There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a pistil . The carpel includes: The stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination and means the plant has been fertilised The style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary The ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form The ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred Though the petal and the sepal are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role.
